It's like that Seinfeld bit on how dads always seem so powerful, because they have discovered that they can tell everyone to screw themselves, they can always leave and make their own people.<br/><br/>Other factions of mankind don't like the bioengineering, it comes to civil war, and mankind somehow destroys itself. A last generation ship with frozen people leaves earth for the bioengineered planets in hope of a new start.<br/><br/>The story is told from two points of view: one is the society of the bioengineered spiders and how they slowly ascend towards high tech over thousands of years, another is told from a 'classicist's POV  who keeps on getting thawed every few hundred years on their way towards the spiders. Lots of war, lots of politics, lots of infighting in both strands of the story, but also cool concepts (<spoiler>later on there's an AI stored in a distributed manner on millions of ants, similar to the soldiers-as-a-computer thing in Liu Cixin's Three-Body Problem</spoiler>).<br/> <br/>A lot of details are a bit too black-and-white for me (<spoiler>the spiders being a matriarchal society which is identically sexist to our patriarchal one, including 'girls will be girls' etc. - the weird handwavy way mankind destroyed itself, you'd think you can't write one virus that takes down a network of space stations and planets - religion as a ossifying force</spoiler>), but I guess you can look past that. The other problem is the info-dumpyness, at least half of this book tries to explain spider society to you. SF writers often employ the trick of having an outsider come in who has to learn about the new society as much as the reader (most famous example: Brave New World), but Tchaikovsky ignores that trick and goes straight for the 'non-fiction' blocks.<br/><br/>It's epic-time-scale SF similar to Tau Zero or Asimov's Foundation books, but more focused on telling an entertaining story than those two.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It would have easily appeared to you if you would have an <i>iota</i> of interest in your chosen field!'), and if you would fail he would be personally offended. His style is rambling and aggressive, so much to teach but so little time, but it's not empty posturing, it's because he loves this. There are copious exhibits from English poetry of the last 500 years or so, but very little explanation, he often gets so excited that there's no time to develop thoughts or explain sentences, on a poem by Chaucer:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>English lyric, the technique for singing already complete, no augmentation of singability from Chaucer's days to our won. The French fourteenth-century lyric mode, common to all Europe. Idiom has changed, but no greater <i>fitness to be sung</i> has been attained. NOt even by Shakespeare with the aid of later Italian song-books.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>If you love your field you may end up having little time for those who just treat it as a hobby, or by  a way to make money:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>From the time Thos. Jefferson jotted down an amateur's notes on what seemed to be the current practice of English versification, the general knowledge, especially among hacks, appears to be have diminished to zero, and to have passed into infinite negative.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Because he has so much to say there are many fields he touches, and the reader is left to explore on her own time what Pound wanted to include. But he is <i>never</i> unfair:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I think it would be sheer idiocy to try to force this kind of reading [reading all of Pope's long poems] on the general reader, and nothing could dry up the interest of a young student more quickly than telling him he must, should, or ought to BE INTERESTED in such pages. Such reading is not even training for writers. It is a specialized form of archaeology.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There is some overlap with Borges' relatively recently published lectures on English literature, in that both are much more concerned with how it sounds, how it has an impact on <i>you</i>, than with any technicalities. Borges, blind, would let his students read poems aloud, then exclaim how beautiful they sound, and move on to the next poet. Learning technicalities won't teach you inner depth.<br/><br/>Recommended for: friends of poetry, especially in English, especially around 1800<br/><br/>P.S.: Bonus quote:<br/><blockquote><br/>The chief cause of false writing is economic. Many writers need or want money. These writers could be cured by an application of banknotes.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

That was already the main theme in his first collection (Stories of Your Life And Others), with one story in a world where angels, miracles, and hell are real and angelic visitations are absolutely terrifying (<i>Hell is the absence of God</i>), or one story where the geocentric model is the correct one (<i>Tower of Babylon</i>).<br/><br/>The second collection is very much like that, so no surprises there. What's really cool is a small 'making of' section at the end where Chiang explains his intentions and inspirations behind each story.<br/><br/>Let's go through the stories, with some comments:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li><i>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate</i> - Time travel is real, but only between specific gates. You can only travel to the time points in which the gate existed, so you can't go very far. The story itself is structured like <i>One Thousand and One Nights</i>, a few stories within one larger story, all concerning different 'users' of these gates in a Middle Eastern past setting.</li><br/><li><i>Exhalation</i> - some-kind-of-robots are discovering that time is slowing down for them, but why? So a robo-scientist sets out to dissect his own brain to find an explanation, what are thoughts made of for robots? This one has a great twist/solution, I loved it</li><br/><li><i>What's Expected of Us</i> - I've read this one in Nature first - a small machine is released which displays a light about a second before you press it. What sounds like a small gadget actually causes a crisis in mankind, as it shows that we have no free will! This one reminded me of an earlier story by Chiang, <i>Division By Zero</i>, where a mathematician has a crisis after proving mathematics to be inconsistent</li><br/><li><i>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</i> - In some kind of online VR system people develop simple artificial intelligence in the form of cutesy creatures, but the company goes bankrupt, and only the hard core of fans keeps on looking after their creatures over decades. This was published before as a separate novella, and I still don't really like it; the basic idea is cool (if you want truly mature AI, be prepared that you will have to raise it like a human child for 20 years), but it's just very long for what it wants to say. There is, however, tech-melancholia which should have its own term - that feeling you get when you visit an IRC channel of your youth, and find it barren. Everyone has left. Is there a German word for this?</li><br/><li><i>Dacey's Patent Automatic Nanny</i> - Very short story about an automatic child-rearing robot in a Victorian/steampunky setting. Didn't leave much of an impression on me.</li><br/><li><i>The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling</i> - This one was my favorite. A new technology allows people to easily search through video recordings of their life. There's a parallel story of a tribe which is first introduced to writing. This is tightly constructed and has a point which I've never heard of before - we as mankind switched from a oral to a literal society with writing, which had profound impacts on our collective psyche. However, our internal monologue is still oral, we believe about ourselves what we want to believe. With the searchable self-video system that internal world also becomes literal, and people's (including the narrator's) self-perceptions shatter. Again, this was my favorite story, I find that switch from oral to literal absolutely fascinating.</li><br/><blockquote><br/>And I think I found the real benefit of digital memory. The point is not to prove you were right; the point is to admit you were wrong.<br/></blockquote><br/><li><i>The Great Silence</i> - A parrot asks us why we are so interested in talking with aliens if there are animals on our earth that can already talk, and have shown signs of intelligence? This was apparently (thanks making-of at the end!) for an exhibition, which explains why it isn't as 'rich' as the other stories, it was intended to be projected in bits, so less of a chance to really flesh out this material?<br/><br/></li><br/><li><i>Omphalos</i> - similar to the <i>Tower of Babylon</i>, what happens if the Copernican model of the world is real? In this case we follow an archeologist who digs up items supporting young earth creatonism, early humans without navels, early trees where the age-rings kind of start in the middle, and so on. There's another collective-psyche-shattering-event in this story which I'd rather not spoil!</li><br/><li><i>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom</i> - a new device is released, you press a button, and two time lines diverge. You are in one time line, and can (for a few gigs of data!) communicate with other humans in the other time line. They differ by just one atom but over time, this is enough to cause drastic changes, so older devices are worth more. Again, there's a kind of mental crisis: people can search for and interrogate timelines where their life-altering decisions turned out differently. Some people become incapable of making decisions, some can't get past their grief as long as they can talk with their still-living partner in another time-line, and so on. The story concerns two women who fell out with each other during high school, how their lives developed differently, and what they could have done differently. This is a beautiful story.</li><br/></ul><br/><br/>Personally, <i>The Truth Of Fact</i> <i>Omphalos</i>, and <i>Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom</i> were the strongest stories in here (interestingly, two of these three stories weren't published before!). Like Borges used to, Chiang really understands how to build an alternative universe and then strictly think it to the end. Like the best writers of SF, Chiang understands that the machine, the technology is just a mirror for mankind, for its anxieties and obsessions: it's never about tech, it's always about the human.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Thompson wrote the absolute masterpiece of <i>Pop. 1280</i>, which everyone should read, and the connection to Chaze's writing is obvious - both feature antiheroes somewhat outside of society, people who would play by the rules if they had ever learned them, but they're too poor, obstinate, hard-headed to even bother learning (another obvious connection (also dug up and republished by NYRB) is Carpenter's <i>Hard Rain Falling</i>). <br/><br/>The unlikely-named Tim Sunblade escapes prison and sets out to make as much money as possible. He meets a prostitute who, like him, is on the run and has always lived on the fringes of society.

You sit in your living room and hear a siren and it’s a small and lonesome thing and all it means to you is that you have to listen until it goes away. But when it is after you, it is the texture of the whole world. You will hear it until you die.

Keefe uses the story of her disappearance (only sixteen people were 'disappeared' - killed and their bodies hidden - by the provisional IRA - many, many more were killed and their bodies dumped in the streets as warnings) as a chance to explain the history of the Provisional IRA, and a history of the Troubles, and why Gerry Adams is Not A Nice Man (his Wikipedia article is much nicer than the book!). The book focuses on a few key personalities of the Provisional IRA, especially the Price sisters (one of them is on the cover), as those two 'might' have had a key part in the killing of McConville, but were also the most famous Provisional IRA members.<br/><br/>As a German I'm not particularly well-versed in the history of the Troubles, so this was a stellar introduction and overview. What particularly struck me is how similar the people around the Price sisters were to the German RAF: very young, violent people dying in secretly coordinated hunger strikes in purpose-built prisons, fighting against a system they see unjust while the system force-feeds them.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a timely introduction to the Troubles in preparation of what's happening right now and what's to come, you'll have to read this book. The Provos haven't gone away, just like the Official IRA they're being replaced by their children's organisations.<br/><br/><br/>P.S.:<br/><blockquote><br/>The continued existence of republican and loyalist outfits didn’t hurt the peace process – it helped it. It was because of the ‘authority’ conferred by these persisting hierarchies that such groups were able to ‘influence, restrain and manage’ their members, the report maintained, noting that there had been only ‘limited indications of dissent to date’, which were quickly dealt with ‘by the leadership’.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I'm not sure?, but Infinite Detail clearly is about the anxieties Facebook, Google and the ubiquitous Internet have caused, the loss of privacy, more importantly, the loss of <i>private space</i>.<br/><br/>There are two intertwined stories featuring mostly the same characters - one is <i>Before</i>, set in the close future, where glasses-like devices called Spex have taken over as smart phone replacements. Facebook, Google, etc. are all still there, and have only become more powerful. Cars are all self-driving, and people are even more constantly hooked into the network:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>We’re not imagining things. And nobody planned this, no cabal of evil old white men in a smoky room. Nobody is in control, and believing that someone might be is where we all start to fail. This is just the political reality, it is just what happened. It’s what we all let happen. It’s the endgame of capitalism.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The story in the <i>Before</i> follows a few Internet and privacy activists (think EFF) in the UK and the US and describes their alternative zone in Bristol, where they jam the worldwide net and have their own local version, an area where artists flourish and an alternative lifestyle is possible (by the way, similar zones were erected during the Arab Spring - the governments shut down the internet to stop people organising, so local digital networks were built).<br/><br/>The story in the <i>Before</i> slowly progresses towards a quasi-apocalypse, the great breakdown of the Internet due to some kind of virus (Maughan never uses the word 'virus' because it would be ridiculous, but most people would understand that?). The breakdown causes a kind of apocalypse, a collapse of all supply chains, of all communications, of all transport, there's chaos, warlords rise up, the remains of the UK army start to enslave people to farm food,  and so on. <br/><br/>The second part of the story, the <i>After</i>, is set some time after this collapse, but featuring mostly the same characters who are trying to figure out what actually happened, and trying to bring order back into the chaos, to organise. The main character is hugely into UK drum'n'bass, tries to find samples, tries to generate something new but doesn't have the technical means to do so - while other early activists are trying to hide from the army, and trying to find their friends.<br/><br/>It feels like the book is heavily influenced by Mark Fischer. A lot of the characters' discussions on capitalism and the system they fight feels like it comes from Fischer's [b:Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?|6763725|Capitalist Realism  Is There No Alternative?|Mark Fisher|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1426633608s/6763725.jpg|6961573]. The <i>After</i> part feels like Fischer's hauntology come to life, British jungle music as a nostalgia for a future that never happened, which perfectly describes the nostalgia the characters in the <i>After</i> have (as described in Fischer's [b:Ghosts of My Life: Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures|20863042|Ghosts of My Life  Writings on Depression, Hauntology and Lost Futures|Mark Fisher|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400856745s/20863042.jpg|40201556]). Since there's a lot about electronic music here, allusions to Hakim Bey's [b:TAZ: The Temporary Autonomous Zone|189938|TAZ  The Temporary Autonomous Zone (New Autonomy)|Hakim Bey|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386920334s/189938.jpg|183616] are not missing, either. I would <i>love</i> to know what Fischer thinks of Maughan's book, but he's dead, how dare he<br/><br/>If there's one thing to criticize, then this: there are so many ideas and concepts here that the story itself seems to suffer, a lot of the book is 'exploring the world', not 'growing the characters'. Rush is the only one who seems to develop, and that's only because the other characters learn 'the truth' about the time of his disappearance as the story progresses, not because the character itself develops. Like Stanislaw Lem, Maughan seems to be more interested in the societal repercussions of his scenarios than repercussions on a personal, psychological level?<br/><br/>Anyway, this is where cyberpunk and SF will develop into - from anxiety about the loss of physical self-determination (think biomods in 80s cyberpunk) to anxiety about the loss of psychological self-determination (think fake news).<br/><br/>P.S.: After Helen DeWitt's [b:Some Trick: Thirteen Stories|36327047|Some Trick  Thirteen Stories|Helen DeWitt|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1524861875s/36327047.jpg|58003380] contained the first-ever R code I found in a book, Infinite Detail contained the first-ever pastebin I found in a book<br/><br/>P.P.S.: As part of my career I've had interactions with rich people who work in fields I personally loathe, and this book echoes my feelings perfectly - this quote comes from a chance encounter between one of the privacy activists and some kind of stock broker:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Brad seems nice enough—weirdly naïve, even—but Rush can’t shake the realization that he represents everything he hates. All the greed and the ignorance, all the willingness to hand over control to the machines, to take away any sense of human self-determination and to put it in the arms of the network. And all just to keep a few people rich, to squander technology’s potential for real change in order to make a quick, lazy buck.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>All good art comes from anger?<br/><br/>Edit 1: Something I realised only later -one of the main points in Fisher's Capitalist Realism is how alternatives to capitalism have become unimaginable. In the 70s, people fought against capitalism and for communism - then communism collapsed and now there's no real alternative. This is picked up in Infinite Detail in a short discussion - the activists brought the system down, but then they didn't know what to put into its place, and everything floundered.<br/><br/>Edit 2: As part of the promo for this book, Maughan put together a playlist of the 'soundtrack' of this book - lots of electronic music, lots of UK rave, very much 90s jungle, <a href='https://www.mcdbooks.com/features/infinite-detail-playlist'>you can listen to it here</a>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Then, when you come home, it's 4 am or 5 am, have your post-party melancholy  - open the beer you stole when you left, realise that it's already Sunday and you have to go to work or uni again soon, realise that you're alone and lonely, realise that you've grown apart from your family, realise that perhaps you were never that close in the first place, realise that you're incapable of closeness and warmth, realise that you'll die alone. Then put on Scott-Heron's last album, <i>I'm New Here</i>, because it will help.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Despite the lack of mementos and photos from those early years, I can reach down into a barrel, it seems, and bring up scraps of yesterdays once tossed aside like gum wrappers. The raw feelings, like shock or sharp pain, or fear suddenly grabbing your heart, are closest to the top, easiest to reach. They return to me unbidden at times.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><img src='https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/592c693f5e6ef95969327dff/2:1/w_648/fa229c9d.jpg'><br/><br/>His earlier music is more angry, political, funk/jazz/proto-hip-hop, there's a good chance you've listened to his 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised', either sampled in a song or the original. This autobiography here is a series of autobiographical essays, loosely connected, of which the majority is set in the 70s and 80s. As the afterword says, Scott-Heron initially started to write this because he was annoyed how little credit Stevie Wonder got for Wonder's fight to have Martin Luther King's birthday recognised as a public holiday, a fight in which Gil Scott-Heron was frequently involved. From there it branched out - since this book is posthumously compiled and released, there was a lot of earlier and later material that could be added together - and it became a quasi-autobiography.<br/><br/>'Quasi' because some of the essays/chapters jump by ten years, and often I had no clue what he was talking about as the essay's focus wasn't 'what was I doing in my life' but 'what was happening on the day X happened', for example, 'what was it like touring with Stevie Wonder, the day John Lennon was killed' (that's a whole chapter). That approach turns the book into a pastiche, if you're here to learn more about the man's life, chances are that you won't be helped. For that it's too impressionistic, too much essay, too little chronological <br/><br/>Personally, I loved the beginning much more than the end - where he described his upbringing, his family:<br/><blockquote><br/>Love was not an active verb in my family or in my life. There were few demonstrations, few hugs and embraces, and few declarations among us about love. I was a full-grown adult who had been married, a father, and divorced before I consciously put “I love you” into conversations with my mother, before I made sure I got a hug from her and gave her a big hug each time we met. I can’t remember ever hearing “I love you” pass between the generations of Scotts that preceded me. Or recall with any clarity hearing those words from them to me or being inspired to say those words to them. Yet I can’t imagine there being more warmth and laughter shared with genuine empathy and respect and consideration and . . . but not affection. Our codes and slang<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and you learn how tremendously driven the man must have been when he was young - going to a private school on a scholarship, running odd jobs on the weekends and the nights to survive, then going to a famous university, only to drop out after a year to write a novel with no money or financial family support - then to actually finish that novel, get it to his dream publisher, have $2000 dollars advance 1960s money offered (!), then to <i>walk away</i> because the publisher wanted to change too much. Could you have done that in your early 20s? I couldn't.<br/><br/>Recommended for: people into Gil Scott-Heron or 70s/80s African-American music scene, people who come from broken homes<br/><br/>Bonus quote!<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>All I can say is that if the truth is important to you, understand that most things of value have to be worked for, sought out, thought about, and brought about after effort worthy of the great value it will add to your life. It will come at a great price. The time and sweat invested in that pursuit may cost you in hours and days you cannot use in other directions. It may cost you relationships that you would give almost anything else to develop, with someone who cannot stand to come in second to anything. The passion with which you commit yourself to something intangible may well turn away the very support that could sustain you.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The wizards are ancient - there are ex-inquisitors, there's Merlin - and the institute is full of old and new magic (Ifrits, Djinns, homunculi) - much of the book concerns these colourful characters, there's very little overarching story, most of this book is short loosely connected stories set in the institute, nothing develops or anything.<br/><br/>it's like a mix of Douglas Adams' [b:Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|365|Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency (Dirk Gently #1)|Douglas Adams|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1156911116s/365.jpg|1042123], or Stanislaw Lem's Pilot Pirx stories or his [b:The Futurological Congress: From the Memoirs of Ijon Tichy|733473|The Futurological Congress  From the Memoirs of Ijon Tichy|Stanisław Lem|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387704942s/733473.jpg|1271698], a whole lot of Charles Stross' Laundry Stories like [b:The Atrocity Archives|101869|The Atrocity Archives (Laundry Files, #1)|Charles Stross|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1440461724s/101869.jpg|322252], a bit of Bulgakov's [b:The Master and Margarita|117833|The Master and Margarita|Mikhail Bulgakov|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327867963s/117833.jpg|876183] and lastly, a little bit of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Of these books you have the mystic couches, the satire of office and the satire Soviet society and petit bourgeois politics, tons of wacky random events, magic, and the fun.<br/><br/>Many jokes don't really work because I don't have the cultural background, I can see that the joke alludes to something but I don't get the allusion. There's one scene where the main character rides on a time machine, but he rides into the future of <i>fiction</i>. The near future is of course the setting of science-fiction, so he spots hundreds of identical rockets where hundreds of young hunks shoot off into the unknown, while their beautiful girls stare wistfully after them. That's clearly making fun of the SF tropes of the time, but I just don't know them! Other times are clear allusions to Soviet politics and well-known people - I have no idea who's who. One scientist tries to create the 'ideal man', which is clearly an allusion to the Soviet mission of human betterment - and so on, these jokes are 50 years old and you can feel it.<br/><br/>But that's all saved by two beautiful scenes - one (where the title comes from) where the protagonist describes how all magicians go out for New Year's parties, but come back to work after midnight (<i>Monday Begins on Saturday</i>) not because they're forced to work, but because they love their 'mission', their life's work more than they like to party. It's like the best days working in science, when you come home but keep on thinking about your work because it's so much interesting fun (but - it can also be incredibly toxic when you force yourself to work 24/7!).<br/>The other beautiful part is the last story, because there's a mind-blowing twist in there that I haven't read in other science-fiction, ever. I loved that part to pieces and I need more of it!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Angels perched unseen on the shrouds and crosstrees. Young men, fated to survive and become old men dying abed half a century hence, would forever remember this hour, when an army at dawn made for the open sea in a cause none could yet comprehend. Ashore, as the great fleet glided past, dreams of them stepped, like men alive, into the rooms where their loved ones lay sleeping.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>In history lessons back in Germany, we never learned about North Africa in WW2. History in Germany in the 90s/early 200s very much focused on the Weimar Republic, the rise of Hitler, and the end of Hitler, much in the middle was skipped. From modern Germany's stand-point that strategy is completely understandable: you want to tell your future citizens what went wrong in the past, so that they're prepared for the future. Making them study endless battle movements won't help, but understanding the atmosphere in the dying Weimar Republic does. (yet here we are, with neo-Nazis back in the open, so what good did that plan do...)<br/><br/>Therefore, almost everything in this book was news to me! A history of the North African campaign with a strong focus on the allied side of the war, helped by Atkinson's perfect and polished story-telling. Atkinson has an uncanny feeling as to when it gets too dry - when you start to get bored of troop movements or 'engagements', Atkinson <i>zooms in</i> and delivers three pages of a mini biography of a larger-than-life character, like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>One man who did not understand was the New Zealanders' legendary commander, Lieutenant General Bernard C. Freyberg. [..] Known as Tiny to his troops, he had a skull the size of a medicine ball, with a pushbroom mustache and legs that extended like sycamore trunks from his khaki shorts. In the Great War, he had won the Victoria Cross on the Somme, served as a pallbearer for his great friend Rupert Brooke, and emerged so seamed by shrapnel that when Churchill once persuaded him to display his wounds the count reached twenty-seven. More were to come. Oarsman, boxer, simmer of the English Channel [..]. No greater heart beat in British battle dress.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And that's only the first page of three!<br/><br/>Three things I learned:<br/>- at the beginning of the war, the British and the Americans were unprepared and inexperienced - I guess they mostly won this war because the Soviets overwhelmed the Axis and took all available forces and attention<br/>- when the Vichy government was still active, the French actively fought the Allied forces, leading to thousands of dead Allied!<br/>- many British and Americans hated each other for major parts of the campaign, leading to countless unnecessary deaths, no collaboration at all<br/><br/>Atkinson has a beautiful <i>Wortschatz</i> and uses hundreds of quotes from soldiers' and commanders' diaries, letters, and notes to pump life into the book, with heaps of small anecdotes to break up the story:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Churchill, upon hearing Montgomery boast that abstinence made him ""100 percent fit"", replied that he both drank and smoked and was ""<i>200</i> percent fit"".<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for a start on World War II, start here - I see why this got the Pulitzer.<br/><br/>P.S.: Atkinson quotes this song at the end of the book:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As [German prisoners] shuffled to their cages, GI guards issued orders in a hybrid tongue of English and Yiddish, then sang their own song:<br/><br/>    Are ve not der Supermen?<br/>    Ya, ve iss der Supermen, super-dooper Supermen...<br/><br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That song comes from a Disney wartime cartoon! <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn20oXFrxxg'>You should watch it, it's amazing!</a>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The man was in the act to raise his goodly goblet,—gold it was and double-eared, —and even now guided it in his hands to drink the wine. Death gave his heart no notice. For who could think that in this company of feasters one of the crowd, however strong, could bring upon him cruel death and dismal doom? But Odysseus aimed an arrow and hit him in the throat; right through his tender neck the sharp point passed. He sank down sideways; from his hand the goblet fell when he was hit, and at once from his nose ran a thick stream of human blood. Roughly he pushed his table back, kicking it with his foot, and scattered off the food upon the floor.

And as the wide-winged thrushes or the doves strike on a net set in the bushes; and when they think to go to roost a cruel bed receives them; even so the women held their heads in line, and around every neck a noose was laid, that they might die most vilely. They twitched their feet a little, but not long.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Wilson:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“I refuse to grant these girls<br/>a clean death, since they poured down shame on me<br/>and Mother, when they lay beside the suitors.”<br/><br/>At that, he wound a piece of sailor’s rope<br/>round the rotunda and round the mighty pillar,<br/>stretched up so high no foot could touch the ground.<br/>As doves or thrushes spread their wings to fly<br/>home to their nests, but someone sets a trap—<br/>they crash into a net, a bitter bedtime;    <br/>just so the girls, their heads all in a row,<br/>were strung up with the noose around their necks<br/>to make their death an agony. They gasped,<br/>feet twitching for a while, but not for long<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Voß:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Wahrlich, den reinen Tod des Schwertes sollen die Weiber<br/>Mir nicht sterben, die mich und meine Mutter so lange<br/>Schmäheten und mit den Freiern so schändliche Greuel verübten!<br/>Sprach’s, da band er ein Seil des blaugeschnäbelten Schiffes<br/>An den ragenden Pfeiler und knüpft’ es hoch am Gewölbe<br/>Fest, daß die Hangenden nicht mit den Füßen die Erde berührten.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Interesting that only Fagles has Odysseus directly speak to the women and call them 'sluts' - neither Palmer nor Wilson even have that sentence. Voß misses two or three sentences all the other translators have.<br/><br/>It's amazing how different these translations are, not just in choice of words, but even in content.

Ever felt bored by a TED talk, feeling like it doesn't do enough? Ever felt uneasy about yet another billionaire spouting they'll use their money to save the world? Ever felt uneasy as to how everyone keeps on saying that the world keeps on improving, but all you see is growing misery? Then this is the book for you.<br/><br/>Anand Giridharadas (ex-McKinsey, now a Henry Crown Fellow) has benefited from the global elite system, but he's clearly dissatisfied with it. He calls it MarketWorld - a small community of the ultra-rich (you know, Bill Gates, Bill Clinton and the like) who keep on giving their money away while jetting from Aspen to world leaders, all preaching the gospel that only the market will save us all. MarketWorld does not allow for dissent, it is a world that believes that in globalised capitalism there can only be winners, all they need to do is a) throw money at the problem while b) ignoring dissent - the system itself is not allowed to be questioned.<br/><br/>Since he's more of a journalist than a philosopher this book is long-form reporting and transcribed interviews than a polemic, and that helps a lot - Giridharadas has a knack on showing how the funding and donating elites, many of which have made their fortune by making the world an objectively worse place - keep on lying to themselves, keep on ignoring what made them rich. His prime example are the Tischs, famous philanthropists who made their fortune partially in tobacco, and the Sacklers, who are also philanthropists but made their fortune by aggressively marketing OxyContin, main cause of the opioid crisis in the US.<br/><br/>There's a wonderful polemic aimed at 'thought leaders' in the middle. As opposed to 'critics', 'thought leaders' are not allowed to criticise the status quo - for example, they do not allow themselves to criticise a sexist system, they instead teach women how important 'power poses' are. No change is allowed, 'everybody wins' if they just pose enough.<br/><br/>The end of the book concerns the rise of Trump, and how it <i>could</i> have been an awakening of MarketWorld - instead, they doubled down. Just look at the problems the Emmanuel Macron faces right now: people are extremely dissatisfied with the distant way French and EU politics are handed but all he has to offer is the language of MarketWorld. Giridharadas focuses on Bill Clinton's shock, but I keep on seeing the same shock in current news and columns on Trump. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Clinton piled on to this idea of false consciousness. “All these English counties voted to give up economic aid from the EU,” he said. “And they needed it, but they had no idea what they were doing. They just wanted to come inside and close the door. There is a kind of a visceral us-and-them mentality developing.” This was the diagnosis of the former president of the United States a few months after Brexit’s unexpected success, and two months before his wife’s unexpected defeat to a populist demagogue who allied himself with the Brexit campaign. The people setting themselves the task of understanding the anger around them were precommitted to the idea that the anger had no possible basis in reason or conscious choice. They could not process people who saw the world fundamentally differently than MarketWorlders did and, misguided or not, wanted to be heard.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Most 'elite' journalists can't explain Trump, and about 90% of columns I see are more wishful thinking ('Trump will get arrested! anyyyy dayyyy now!') than realistic, down-in-the-dirts analysis. After reading this, I bet $50 they'll re-elect Trump. Trump never really played the game the Clintons played, he's not walking around pretending like he's saving the world with his money, he's much more old-school cut-throat capitalist. I guess people misunderstand what Trump's voters see in him - of course it's weird that the man with golden toilets says he is all about the small man, but Trump never played the MarketWorld game.<br/><br/>It's funny, I myself benefit strongly from MarketWorld - my house is built by the Forrest Foundation, funded by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Forrest'>a Western Australian mining billionaire</a>. I know what I'm going to give out at Christmas.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's unclear how she died, and he doesn't really remember. He tries on and off to solve the mystery, but he doesn't make much headway, as others around him are almost as easily confused, as much of a blank slate, as he is. The police is supposed to investigate but Chico, the town's main policeman, never had a murder, so he drifts in circles at his desk.<br/><br/>Over time the reader learns that Franny was almost, or  even more, as mentally not-quite-there as David. David keeps on finding notes (threats) in the most unlikely places, like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I WILL CROSS-STITCH AN IMAGE OF YOUR FUTURE HOME BURNING. I WILL HANG THIS IMAGE OVER YOUR BED WHILE YOU SLEEP.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some of these threats seem brand-new, some of them date back years.

Trungpa was a friend of Suzuki, and Suzuki spoke highly of Trungpa. History has shown to be Trungpa to be... not a good man? He would often have sexual relationships with his students, once even using his 'guards' to strip students naked (see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%B6gyam_Trungpa#Controversies'>Wikipedia</a>). To me that doesn't sound particularly enlightened, more like someone abusing their position.<br/><br/>Here we have a few collected speeches of Trungpa, and they're actually *good*, if a bit too short. I can see why his style of meditation immediately became popular in the West, it's meditation without a need for religion or spirituality: ' In fact, it is the essence of meditation. Whatever one does, whatever one tries to practice, is not aimed at achieving a higher state or at following some theory or ideal, but simply, without any object or ambition, trying to see what is here and now.'<br/><br/>There is an amazing discussion of how the ego is in your way, and by giving away things (even only symbolically, like a single cheap thing you are emotionally attached to) is one way of getting away from your ego - similar like having a teacher won't help you learn new things (in meditation, at least) but they're a way to protect you from your ego, as their teaching will come from the outside:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>So one must also be very grateful to the teacher. And that is a great protection against the ego, since you do not look on it as something discovered within yourself, but as something which someone else has given you. He gives you this gift; although in reality the transmission is not, as we said, something given to you, it is simply discovered within oneself.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Funny enough, opposing the title there is not much advice on how to meditate 'best', Trungpa leaves that to the personal teachers.<br/><br/><br/>Some other good advice:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>For unless one is able to overcome this excitement, one will not be able to learn, because any form of emotional excitement has a blinding effect. One fails to see life as it is because one tends so much to build up one’s own version of it. Therefore one should never commit oneself or conform to any religious or political structure without first finding the real essence of what one is looking for. Labeling oneself, adopting an ascetic way of life or changing one’s costume—none of these brings about any real transformation.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Curiously, there's a lot of good stuff here, even if you're not looking to learn more about Buddhism or meditation.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Not just writing down your experiments in your lab-book, but drafting and endlessly editing your papers, your book-chapters, your thes(i/e)s, and then later, endless grant applications. I'm currently writing an ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) application, which is the one thing everyone goes for a few years after their PhD, a first step towards their own lab. If you're successful, the Australian government (well, their Research Council) will pay your salary for three years, that's it. <br/><br/>The average time it takes an academic to write a DECRA from start to finish is between <b>one and two months</b>, <i>full-time writing</i>. I'm fast approaching that number and I haven't even <i>finished the first draft</i> (they change the rules each year - this year got another small question for which they want 100 words, so that's a 100 words that have to be as concise and clear as possible). What's more, the DECRA is a <i>small</i> grant! Those grants worth million of dollars (ARC Training Centres, for example) are easily double or triple the size. When we plan a new PhD student's time, we allocate between 6 and 12 months just for writing the final thesis.<br/><br/>So it's no wonder that I like to read book about the use of English, especially since it's just my second language.<br/><br/>Benjamin Dreyer has been the copy-chief for Random House for a long time, and as such, he has seen all the horror the (writing) world has to offer. He is a funny writer, and what's best, he is a lover of the living and breathing English language:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Does the latter perhaps sound a bit stilted? Perhaps it does, but to be perfectly honest, there’s a certain tautness in slightly stilted prose that I find almost viscerally thrilling.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There’s nothing wrong with “different than,” and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. If you say “different to,” you’re likely a Brit, and that’s OK too.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>The best part about Dreyer's main message is that ""it's OK to write like you do (in most cases)"", as English is a weird language where not anything goes, but boy can you fit in a lot. Many of the formatting or spelling examples he points out and corrects don't really have a 'rule', fixing them just makes the sentence look better, or reading it out loud makes it sound better. The main target audience is clearly fiction writers, but I still found some valuable advice and tricks for my scientific writing.<br/><br/>The second half of the book didn't really do it for me - these were long lists of wittily commented common word confusions and common misspellings, but since I don't write fiction I didn't care for those lists.<br/><br/>Since the author (and in extension, all copy-editors) can feel nitpicky, I have two things to nitpick!<br/><br/>- The author writes:<br/><blockquote><br/>People who couldn’t care less about “could care less” will, faced with the use of “impact” as a verb, geschrei the house down, and that mob that sees fifty shades of red, scarlet, and carmine over the relatively newfangled use of “begs the question” to mean “raises the question” may well pass by a “comprised of” without so much as batting an eye. As a copy editor, I tend to steer writers toward geschrei-proof language because, [..]<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I don't know how much 'geschrei' has made it into colloquial English, but the first usage is 'geschrei' as a verb, so it's lower case (in German), but the second one is a noun, so in German you'd write that in capitals ('Geschrei-proof')<br/><br/>- In the itemised section of misspelled or weirdly compounded words like 'ATM machine' Dreyer writes:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Mount Fujiyama<br/>As we note that yama means “mountain,” we also note that we can refer to Fujiyama or to Mount Fuji.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Mount Fuji is spelled: 富士山. The 山 on its own is read 'yama', which is where Fujiyama comes from (can you spot the mountains?). However, if it is added to another noun the reading becomes 'san', so 'Fujisan' is the correct name (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Fuji'>Wikipedia has it too</a>), and I wonder how 'Fujiyama' ever made it into English. 'Fujiyama' does not exist in Japanese.<br/><br/>However, since this is a book on English and not on my native German or my broken Japanese, and the English language just does as it pleases, I guess both are fine?<br/><br/><br/>P.S.:<br/><br/>Dreyer's advice:<br/><blockquote><br/>Build yourself, on either a virtual or a paper tablet, what’s known as a commonplace book—someplace you can copy down bits of writing you encounter and find clever and/or meaningful—and keep it handy for future use, even if that future use is simply your own edification. (Don’t forget to make note of where you found the stuff.) Then at least, should you find yourself in a position to share with the world your own wisdom and want to periodically sprinkle it with others’ smarts, you’ll at least have something fresh and heartfelt to offer.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I've got more than 25,000 lines in my Kindle Clippings.txt that goes back to 2014 and includes quotes and excerpts from 442 books (including the one I just pasted there).

You have plenty, and you have just enough problems. This is a mysterious thing, you know, the mystery of life. We have just enough problems, not too many or too few.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Here we have the biography of Shunryu Suzuki, the Japanese Zen master who popularised Zazen in the West in the 1960s, written by one of his disciples. I haven't read many books on Zen - only [b:Sit Down and Shut Up: Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye|676003|Sit Down and Shut Up  Punk Rock Commentaries on Buddha, God, Truth, Sex, Death, and Dogen's Treasury of the Right Dharma Eye|Brad Warner|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328854835s/676003.jpg|662004] about 10 years ago - and I didn't grow up in the US counter-culture movement, so I wasn't particularly aware of Suzuki, but it's still a highly enjoyable biography of an obviously kind-hearted, but conflicted, person.<br/><br/>Chadwick describes Suzuki's upbringing in Japan as a son of a Zen temple's abbot, his training to take over the temple, and his dreams of moving to the US to teach Zen to westerners. Suzuki was an 'original' by definition, a 'Schalk' in German:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When Seison showed Shunryu a beautiful large pot that bore his characteristic splash of crimson, he told Shunryu he wasn’t going to sell it. “Good,” said Shunryu, “I’ll take it,” and he did. Later when Seison and his son were visiting Rinso-in, he brought a wooden storage box he had made for the pot. Shunryu asked Seison if he would give the pot a name and write it in sumi on the box. “Pot stolen by a monk,” Seison wrote, to Shunryu’s delight.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The book is full of tiny quotes and snippets from Suzuki's speeches and books, and serve as a good (if cursory) intro to Zen Buddhist thought, like the one I put at the top of this text. Along the story of Suzuki's life you get heaps of small funny stories like the one above, but also some darker points, such as his complicated relationship with his children and his wife, <br/><br/>You learn about his move to the US in his 50s to become a Japanese community's priest, then subsequent switch to a counter-culture icon (Ginsberg and Watts appear, among many other 'famous' names), founding of the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, then sickness and finally, death. It's not just a biography but an attempt at an introduction to Suzuki's thought - it's always (frustratingly!) hard to pin down Zen or Buddhist thought with its counter-intuitive koans and seemingly illogical exclamations, but you still learn that Suzuki's thought and teaching was very different from contemporary Zen teaching - no koans, only Zazen, only sitting. There are rules as to living in the monastery, but it's not so bad if you break them, as long as you follow them in spirit.<br/><br/>Chadwick's own stories about Suzuki give the book a very warm tone:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I went to Suzuki’s cabin unannounced after dinner one night and was invited in. Never known for moderation, I was, at this time in my life, alternating between periods of austerity and indulgence. I felt guilty. I told him I couldn’t stop snacking in the kitchen. Sometimes I’d sneak into the kitchen at night, eat leftover guest desserts, and drink their half-and-half. Suzuki reached under his desk conspiratorially. “Here, have some jelly beans,” he said.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Suzuki's interaction with the Hippie culture of the 60s and 70s is great fun, great to see how so many people decrying rules and their parents' strict structures suddenly become happy with following a strict day-plan in pursuit of enlightenment (which Suzuki didn't think much of!). I'd like to read more about that!<br/><br/>As a scientist, it's great to think about 'beginner's mind' in your work - like all models, the models we have built over the past 100, 200 years of how reality works are all more-or-less wrong anyway, so it's great not to become bogged down in the 'expert's mind' where there are only few possibilities of outcomes.

Several intertwined and connected stories are framed by a literal pig running through Brussels, I guess that's a joke based on the German 'die Sau durchs Dorf treiben' (to force the pig through the village), which means that you make a big issue out of something. When a small thing is hyped by the press then they are driving the pig through the village. (the joke here is that the press hypes up the story of the phantom pig)<br/><br/>What makes this book such a pleasure to read is that it believes in the concept of the European Union, and that the author wants to tell you what ails it (a good book to read after [b:Mein Jahr als Mörder|1798068|Mein Jahr als Mörder|Friedrich Christian Delius|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1188494240s/1798068.jpg|1797165], which featured the story of a resistance group in the 1930s calling itself the European Union). Most of the main characters believe in the EU's dream, but they are somewhat ground down by the EU's system. Most states forgot what the EU stands for, so they try to get the best for their own country only, and you get some kind of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons'>Tragedy Of The Commons</a> since each state negotiating on its own winds up getting a worse deal. Other characters in the novel are pure careerists, so they try to play it as safe as possible, and the idea is slowly forgotten.<br/><br/>The main story is that the European Commission's birthday is coming up, and one of the protagonists would like to use this event to remind people why they started this project in the first place (I guess this is also what the author is trying to do with the book, <i>neat</i>). The character wants to move the EU's image from a weird faraway bureaucracy to the keeper of history's lessons and human rights. Nationalism leads to racism and war, and in its ultimate consequence, Auschwitz. This I guess is Menasse himself - he wrote similar ideas in nonfiction books before that were mostly ignored, see for example <a href='http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/E/bo24016595.html>this one</a>. And that's why I like the book so much, the project o fthe European Union is a project worth fighting for.<br/><br/>It all sounds dry but it's a very funny, enthralling book - for example, people hate to work in the 'culture' part of the EU since there's no funding and no power, so you get dialogue like 'you got to rescue me from culture!'.<br/>Or: one of the EU bureaucrats has to fly to Auschwitz for a small event, and since it will be cold, he asks the next shop what the best clothes would be, and they recommend German underwear. 'German underwear is the best for Auschwitz!'<br/><br/>This is the best book you can get featuring the bureaucracy of the European Union! Then again, there's maybe 5 books about that.<br/><br/>(I liked it all except for that very strange Dan Brown-like substory of a Vatican assassin that went nowhere, that was just weird)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In der Autobiographie von Armand Moens hatte er gelesen: »Geschichte ist nicht nur die Erzählung davon, was war, sondern auch die stetige Verarbeitung der Gründe, warum Vernünftigeres nicht sein konnte.«<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>P.S.: Is this the first German Book Prize novel that uses the word 'shitstorm'?",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It is not – and can never be – a science; there are no objective truths in economics that can be established independently of political, and frequently moral, judgements. Therefore, when faced with an economic argument, you must ask the age-old question ‘Cui bono?’ (Who benefits?), first made famous by the Roman statesman and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Chang insists that no economic school (neoclassical, Marxist, etc.) is 'right' or 'wrong', but that instead learning about each school and its drawbacks gives you a toolset to think about any economic conundrum. I'm currently reading Crooked Cucumber, a biography of Shunryu Suzuki who popularised Zen Buddhism in the West, and he has this great and fitting quote on schools of Buddhism which fits here too: 'A single piece of thread is not useful until we make a beautiful cloth with it. So each single school of Buddhism is meaningful as part of the overall religious life.'.<br/><br/>Chang is a bit of a sneaky one. He keeps on telling you that he's not trying to tell you what to think, but rather how to think, but he's obviously <i>not</i> a fan of neoliberalism:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Markets run according to the ‘one-dollar-one-vote’ rule, while democratic politics run on the principle of ‘one-person-one-vote’. Thus, the proposal for greater depoliticization of the economy in a democracy is in the end an anti-democratic project that wants to give more power in the running of the society to those with more money.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's a lot of interesting stuff on how neoliberalism isn't really a science, but more an ideology which is written to justify power by the rich, points which are echoed in books like David Harvey's A Brief History Of Neoliberalism, or Anand Giridharadas' amazing Winners Take All (reviews for all of those to follow!).<br/><br/>But why care about arguments of neoliberalism?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Until the 1980s, many people believed that the ‘miracle’ economies of East Asia, such as Japan, Taiwan or Korea, were paragons of free-market policies on the grounds that they had small governments (measured by their budget). However, being small did not mean that these governments were following a laissez-faire approach. During the ‘miracle’ years, they exercised a huge influence on the evolution of their economies through economic planning, regulation and other directive measures. By looking at only the budgetary numbers, people had come to seriously misunderstand the true nature and significance of the government in these countries.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Funny enough, I've been dipping in and out of Studwell's How Asia Works, and the above is more or less the central argument of Studwell, too - countries like Japan which put strong controls on farming lands and the economy in the early days after WW2 have all done tremendously well, while countries in the same region with similar starting conditions who <i>haven't</i> exercised strong economic control (i.e., Malaysia) haven't done well.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>My aim in this book has been to show the reader how to think, not what to think, about the economy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's not all bashing of neoliberalism like my text suggests, this particular critique makes maybe 5 to 10% of the book - the rest is so interesting! Let me show you: One thing I've been doing more and more during my career as a biologist is to start any answer to a question with 'It depends.'. I've lost all capacity to be definite. The same thing goes for economics - are free trade agreements good? It depends. Are both countries at similar levels of development? Then maybe! Is one country severely under-developed? Then it's likely to lose in the long run, as it does not have a local market to build up its own technologies. And so on. Protectionist policies <i>can</i> be useful, and Chang shows this using the Tudors in the UK, and how their protection of the woollen textile industry laid the foundation for the UK's wealth, contrary to the popular story that the UK is rich because of free trade.<br/><br/><blockquote>Behind every economic policy and corporate action that affects our lives – the minimum wage, outsourcing, social security, food safety, pensions and what not – lies some economic theory that either has inspired those actions or, more frequently, is providing justification of what those in power want to do anyway.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><i>Highly</i> recommended if you want to dip your toes into the waters of economics, and you want a critical view at commonly held assumptions.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Funny enough, I'm writing this review while waiting for a flight at the Tokyo-Narita airport, I even had two earthquakes last week (but not as big as the one featured in the story).<br/><br/>What sets this apart from other cyberpunk are two factors:<br/><br/>1) There is <i>much</i> more focus on politics/policy than usual, which makes sense if you look at the author's background. In that regard it's closer to [b:Taiko: An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan|336228|Taiko  An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan|Eiji Yoshikawa|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348457306s/336228.jpg|1337700] than [b:Pattern Recognition|22320|Pattern Recognition (Blue Ant, #1)|William Gibson|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1288326931s/22320.jpg|2455062].<br/><br/>2) All SF is a mirror of the time it has been written in. The focus here is on how governments and large entities can change perceived reality by replacing access to information, i.e., 'fake news'. Most cyberpunk feels stale with a strong 80s feel, but this focus on 'fake news' makes it contemporary. <br/><br/>What a smart book!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

His wealth divides him from rampant crime, he's a self-described liberal who donates money and time to social causes. That all changes when muggers break into his apartment while he's at work, beating his wife to death, and injuring his daugher so badly that afterwards she retreats into a catatonic state. His helplessness at the crime is replaced by anger, he buys a gun, and walks the street at night to shoot muggers, killing a few. His vigilante-ism is soon discovered, he has a few copycats, is mostly admired by the crime-sick population including many policemen. <spoiler>The novel ends with him being discovered by a policeman - the policeman takes off his cap, and walks away.</spoiler><br/><br/>There's a lot here that's typical US-American, vigilante-ism is part of the American psyche: how many movies, how many novels are about one guy making a difference with violence? Their most famous Christmas movie Die Hard, the majority of their Western movies, practically all superhero comic books and movies, it's all about one guy taking up the baton, reality's grey areas be damned. Garfield's characters know this and discuss this with each other.<br/><br/>The other novel I was reminded of was [b:The Death of Grass|941731|The Death of Grass|John Christopher|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1486838846s/941731.jpg|797220], a post-apocalyptic novel where a 'politically liberal' character has to survive the downfall of civilization, and is saved by another character, a US gun-positive 'conservative', and in the course of the novel, 'converts'. Garfield's Paul isn't so flat, there's a specific sequence where he encounters other 'conservative' dogmas and is repulsed - he's only given up on the idea of criminal rehabilitation, not on abortion. And even he knows that he doesn't make much of a difference, his actions are there to help with his grief, it is implied that his actions won't change the city's overall state by much.<br/><br/>It's a nice quick read good for one night - it reportedly took the authors two weeks to write.<br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>Fans of gritty crime neo-noir",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The story around how Egypt's president Nasser tried to build up long-distance rockets, and how Israel thwarted those attempts, is known,  but Bergman has the most outrageous spy story details that I cannot find anywhere else - in a nutshell, 'ex-'Nazis who worked on the V1 and V2 worked for Nasser. <br/><br/>Israel obviously didn't like that, and killing Germans wasn't really the best solution in the 60s (one was killed but that caused huge problems), so what they did instead was to approach Otto Skorzeny, ex-SS who the Mossad had been hunting for decades - they did so by having an agent start an affair with Countess Ilse von Finckenstein (again, spynovel stuff!) who had an 'open marriage' with Skorzeny, and via that connection they managed to promise Skorzeny that they would stop hunting him in exchange for helping the Mossad stop the Germans working for Nasser, which was unheard before for the Mossad. Skorzeny agreed and managed to reconnect with all of Nasser's engineers by inviting them to a huge Mossad-financed party to, can you believe this?,  establish a Fourth Reich. Obviously that hasn't come to pass, but those parties were enough to restart connections, and these connections gave the Mossad enough private and personal information to send realistic threatening letters and phone calls to the Germans, who started to drop out. There's another similarly ridiculous story in the Nasser-saga involving Franz-Joseph Strauss of all people, but i won't put that here. There are <i>many</i> stories like this in this book!<br/><br/>Another interesting thing I learned is how slowly, slowly, slowly over the years all rules and laws of ethics the Mossad and the IDF had flew out the window - first the organisation goes through great pains to make sure no innocents are hurt during the killings, then that is cancelled, then no political leaders were allowed to be killed, but Hamas/Fatah made that <i>very hard</i> so that rule was cancelled too, killings weren't supposed to happen in specific countries but then that was standing in the way of operations so it flew out the window too, etc. pp. It's not a lawless organisation (the PM is still involved in all decisions) but many rules have disappeared.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“I call it the banality of evil,” Ayalon said later, borrowing Hannah Arendt’s observation about what happens when ordinary people are put into corrupt situations that encourage their conformity. “You get used to killing. Human life becomes something plain, easy to dispose of. You spend a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, on who to kill. On how to kill him: two, three days. You’re dealing with tactics, not the implications.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What this book made me understand better is the <i>psychology</i> of the people who order and commit all these killings - it's partially the trauma of the holocaust ('my grandparents let themselves be killed and I will <i>not</i> let another holocaust happen!'), partially the reality of occupying someone else's territory.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>We are the generation of settlement, and without steel helmets and the maw of the cannon we will not be able to plant a tree or build a home. Our children will not live if we do not dig shelters, and without barbed wire fences and machine guns we will not be able to pave roads or drill for water. Millions of Jews, annihilated because they had no country, gaze at us from the dust of Jewish history and command us to settle and raise up a land for our people.<br/>- Moshe Dayan<br/>Most of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting. We must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.<br/>- Meir Dagan<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That is my main takeaway from this book - the world is quick to condemn when Israel killed another Hamas member, but it's much, much more grey than that.<br/><br/>What's Bergman's verdict as to the effectiveness of these killings? Sometimes, they (as part of a larger program!) clearly worked, as with Nasser's rocket program, and more recently Iran's efforts to get a nuclear bomb (mid-level scientists were killed until no-one wanted to work on the project any more), in <i>many</i> other cases, the killings made things worse - for example, when the Mossad killed complete innocents and caused huge diplomatic problems, or when Islamist hardliners were replaced by even more bloodlusty hardliners, or when the killing destabilised conflicts - or didn't help at all, as it was the case when suicide bombers first appeared - how does killing deter suicide bombers (answer: kill the people who send the suicide bombers).<br/><br/>It's a lively written book with tons of verbatim quotes to make it read like a looooong spy thriller. In the age of the SPIEGEL announcing that their star reporter made up everything, all the 'unnecessary' detail here gives me cause for alarm, but it's such a highly readable book. It only took me a few days to read those ~800 pages, so if you're into the history of Israel, or into riveting spy thrillers, take this one",,,1,,,0,,,,,

A lot about politics, propaganda and modern life (both haven't really changed since then it seems), the most impressive thing to me is that even though he nowadays counts as a socialist, he can impartially describe the follies of both left and right without falling for the lies and (self-)deceptions of either side. I don't know any ""modern"" (as in, currently alive) writers who can do this.<br/><br/>As a sidenote, one can find many ""famous"" formulations of Animal Farm or 1984 in these essays before they appeared in the books.<br/><br/>If you read one essay of his, choose this one: <a href=""http://alexgolec.github.io/orwell/politics"">Politics and the English Language</a>, probably the most relevant to contemporary times.<br/><br/>I've underlined about a hundred insightful passages which I'm just going to paste here so that you can get a general idea. All others can stop here.<br/><br/><br/>(Keep in mind that most of these essays are written 1938-1949)<br/><br/>It seems to me a safe assumption that the disease loosely called nationalism is now almost universal. Antisemitism is only one manifestation of nationalism, and not everyone will have the disease in that particular form. A Jew, for example, would not be antisemitic: but then many Zionist Jews seem to me to be merely antisemites turned upside-down, just as many Indians and Negroes display the normal colour prejudices in an inverted form.<br/><br/><br/>But that antisemitism will be definitively CURED, without curing the larger disease of nationalism, I do not believe.<br/><br/>Political or military commentators, like astrologers, can survive almost any mistake, because their more devoted followers do not look to them for an appraisal of the facts but for the stimulation of nationalistic loyalties.<br/><br/>In 1927 Chiang Kai Shek boiled hundreds of Communists alive, and yet within ten years he had become one of the heroes of the Left. The re-alignment of world politics had brought him into the anti-Fascist camp, and so it was felt that the boiling of the Communists ‘didn’t count’, or perhaps had not happened.<br/><br/>PACIFIST: Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf<br/><br/>There is no limit to the follies that can be swallowed if one is under the influence of feelings of this kind. I have heard it confidently stated, for instance, that the American troops had been brought to Europe not to fight the Germans but to crush an English revolution. One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe things like that: no ordinary man could be such a fool.<br/><br/>If you hate and fear Russia, if you are jealous of the wealth and power of America, if you despise Jews, if you have a sentiment of inferiority towards the British ruling class, you cannot get rid of those feelings simply by taking thought. But you can at least recognise that you have them, and prevent them from contaminating your mental processes.<br/><br/>But what this scene, and much else that I saw in Germany, brought home to me was that the whole idea of revenge and punishment is a childish daydream. Properly speaking, there is no such thing as revenge. Revenge is an act which you want to commit when you are powerless and because you are powerless: as soon as the sense of impotence is removed, the desire evaporates also. Who would not have jumped for joy, in 1940, at the thought of seeing S.S. officers kicked and humiliated? But when the thing becomes possible, it is merely pathetic and disgusting. It is said that when Mussolini’s corpse<br/><br/>At the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe — at any rate for short periods — that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.<br/><br/>Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in other words it is war minus the shooting.<br/><br/>However, it appears from President Truman’s remarks, and various comments that have been made on them, that the bomb is fantastically expensive and that its manufacture demands an enormous industrial effort, such as only three or four countries in the world are capable of making. This point is of cardinal importance, because it may mean that the discovery of the atomic bomb, so far from reversing history, will simply intensify the trends which have been apparent for a dozen years past.<br/><br/>But suppose — and really this the likeliest development — that the surviving great nations make a tacit agreement never to use the atomic bomb against one another? Suppose they only use it, or the threat of it, against people who are unable to retaliate? In that case we are back where we were before, the only difference being that power is concentrated in still fewer hands and that the outlook for subject peoples and oppressed classes is still more hopeless.<br/><br/>If you plant a walnut you are planting it for your grandchildren, and who cares a damn for his grandchildren?<br/><br/>Every writer, in any case, is rather that kind of person, but the prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally thankless, irritating and exhausting job. It not only involves praising trash — though it does involve that, as I will show in a moment — but constantly INVENTING reactions towards books about which one has no spontaneous feelings whatever.<br/><br/>People talk about the horrors of war, but what weapon has man invented that even approaches in cruelty some of the commoner diseases? “Natural” death, almost by definition, means something slow, smelly and painful.<br/><br/>This business of people just dying like animals, for instance, with nobody standing by, nobody interested, the death not even noticed till the morning — this happened more than once.<br/><br/>Machiavelli and his followers taught that in politics decency simply does not exist, and, by doing so, Burnham claims, made it possible to conduct political affairs more intelligently and less oppressively. A ruling class which recognised that its real aim was to stay in power would also recognise that it would be more likely to succeed if it served the common good, and might avoid stiffening into a hereditary aristocracy.<br/><br/>Socialism, until recently, was supposed to connote political democracy, social equality and internationalism. There is not the smallest sign that any of these things is in a way to being established anywhere, and the one great country in which something described as a proletarian revolution once happened, i.e. the USSR, has moved steadily away from the old concept of a free and equal society aiming at universal human brotherhood. In an almost unbroken progress since the early days of the Revolution, liberty has been chipped away and representative institutions smothered, while inequalities have increased and nationalism and militarism have grown stronger.<br/><br/>Political predictions are usually wrong, because they are usually based on wish-thinking, but they can have symptomatic value, especially when they change abruptly.<br/><br/>Such a world-picture fits in with the American tendency to admire size for its own sake and to feel that success constitutes justification, and it fits in with the all-prevailing anti-British<br/><br/>Burnham at least has the honesty to say that Socialism isn’t coming; the others merely say that Socialism is coming, and then give the word “Socialism” a new meaning which makes nonsense of the old one.<br/><br/>If I had to make a prophecy, I should say that a continuation of the Russian policies of the last fifteen years — and internal and external policy, of course, are merely two facets of the same thing — can only lead to a war conducted with atomic bombs, which will make Hitler’s invasion look like a tea-party. But at any rate, the Russian régime will either democratise itself, or it will perish. The huge, invincible, everlasting slave empire of which Burnham appears to dream will not be established, or, if established, will not endure, because slavery is no longer a stable basis for human society.<br/><br/>The question only arises because in exploring the physical universe man has made no attempt to explore himself. Much of what goes by the name of pleasure is simply an effort to destroy consciousness.<br/><br/>This mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence is the most marked characteristic of modern English prose, and especially of any kind of political writing. As soon as certain topics are raised, the concrete melts into the abstract and no one seems able to think of turns of speech that are not hackneyed: prose consists less and less of WORDS chosen for the sake of their meaning, and more and more of PHRASES tacked together like the sections of a prefabricated hen-house.<br/><br/>PRETENTIOUS DICTION. Words like PHENOMENON, ELEMENT, INDIVIDUAL (as noun), OBJECTIVE, CATEGORICAL, EFFECTIVE, VIRTUAL, BASIS, PRIMARY, PROMOTE, CONSTITUTE, EXHIBIT, EXPLOIT, UTILIZE, ELIMINATE, LIQUIDATE, are used to dress up simple statements and give an air of scientific impartiality to biased judgments.<br/><br/><br/>MEANINGLESS WORDS. In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning. * Words like ROMANTIC, PLASTIC, VALUES, HUMAN, DEAD, SENTIMENTAL, NATURAL, VITALITY, as used in art criticism, are strictly meaningless, in the sense that they not only do not point to any discoverable object, but are hardly even expected to do so by the reader. When one critic writes, “The outstanding feature of Mr. X’s work is its living quality,” while another writes, “The immediately striking thing about Mr. X’s work is its peculiar deadness,” the reader accepts this as a simple difference of opinion<br/><br/>In the case of a word like DEMOCRACY, not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of régime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using the word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different.<br/><br/>As I have tried to show, modern writing at its worst does not consist in picking out words for the sake of their meaning and inventing images in order to make the meaning clearer. It consists in gumming together long strips of words which have already been set in order by someone else, and making the results presentable by sheer humbug.<br/><br/>A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in.<br/><br/>When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases — BESTIAL ATROCITIES, IRON HEEL, BLOODSTAINED TYRANNY, FREE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, STAND SHOULDER TO SHOULDER— one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy:<br/><br/>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. Things like the continuance of British rule in India, the Russian purges and deportations, the dropping of the atom bombs on Japan, can indeed be defended, but only by arguments which are too brutal for most people to face, and which do not square with the professed aims of political parties. Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called PACIFICATION.<br/><br/>The inflated style is itself a kind of euphemism. A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outlines and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as “keeping out of politics.” All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer. I should expect to find — this is a guess which I have not sufficient knowledge to verify — that the German, Russian and Italian languages have all deteriorated in the last ten or fifteen years as a result of dictatorship.<br/><br/>He has an extraordinarily clear prevision of the spy-haunted “police State”, with its endless heresy-hunts and treason trials, all really designed to neutralize popular discontent by changing it into war hysteria.<br/><br/><br/>If one is capable of intellectual detachment, one can PERCEIVE merit in a writer whom one deeply disagrees with, but ENJOYMENT is a different matter. Supposing that there is such a thing as good or bad art, then the goodness or badness must reside in the work of art itself — not independently of the observer, indeed, but independently of the mood of the observer. In one sense, therefore, it cannot be true that a poem is good on Monday and bad on Tuesday. But if one judges the poem by the appreciation it arouses, then it can certainly be true, because appreciation, or enjoyment, is a subjective condition which cannot be commanded.<br/><br/><br/>In Communist literature the attack on intellectual liberty is usually masked by oratory about “petty-bourgeois individualism”, “the illusions of nineteenth-century liberalism”, etc., and backed up by words of abuse such as “romantic” and “sentimental”, which, since they do not have any agreed meaning, are difficult to answer. In this way the controversy is maneuvered away from its real issue.<br/><br/>From the totalitarian point of view history is something to be created rather than learned. A totalitarian state is in effect a theocracy, and its ruling caste, in order to keep its position, has to be thought of as infallible. But since, in practice, no one is infallible, it is frequently necessary to rearrange past events in order to show that this or that mistake was not made, or that this or that imaginary triumph actually happened. Then again, every major change in policy demands a corresponding change of doctrine and a revelation of prominent historical figures.<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a genuinely non-political literature, and least of all in an age like our own, when fears, hatreds, and loyalties of a directly political kind are near to the surface of everyone’s consciousness. Even a single taboo can have an all-round crippling effect upon the mind, because there is always the danger that any thought which is freely followed up may lead to the forbidden thought. It follows that the atmosphere of totalitarianism is deadly to any kind of prose writer, though a poet, at any rate a lyric poet, might possibly find it breathable. And in any totalitarian society that survives for more than a couple of generations, it is probable that prose literature, of the kind that has existed during the past four hundred years, must actually come to an end. Literature has sometimes<br/><br/>Some, at least, of the English scientists who speak so enthusiastically of the opportunities to be enjoyed by scientists in Russia are capable of understanding this. But their reflection appears to be: “Writers are persecuted in Russia. So what? I am not a writer.” They do not see that any attack on intellectual liberty, and on the concept of objective truth, threatens in the long run every department of thought.<br/><br/>All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.<br/><br/>One’s real reaction to a book, when one has a reaction at all, is usually “I like this book” or “I don’t like it”, and what follows is a rationalisation. But “I like this book” is not, I think, a non-literary reaction; the non-literary reaction is “This book is on my side, and therefore I must discover merits in it”.<br/><br/>To accept an orthodoxy is always to inherit unresolved contradictions. Take for instance the fact that all sensitive people are revolted by industrialism and its products, and yet are aware that the conquest of poverty and the emancipation of the working class demand not less industrialisation, but more and more. Or take the fact that certain jobs are absolutely necessary and yet are never done except under some kind of coercion. Or take the fact that it is impossible to have a positive foreign policy without having powerful armed forces. One could multiply examples. In every such case there is a conclusion which is perfectly plain but which can only be drawn if one is privately disloyal to the official ideology. The normal response is to push the question, unanswered, into a corner of one’s mind, and then continue repeating contradictory catchwords. One does not have to search far through the reviews and magazines to discover the effects of this kind of thinking.<br/><br/>To yield subjectively, not merely to a party machine, but even to a group ideology, is to destroy yourself as a writer. We feel this dilemma to be a painful one, because we see the need of engaging in politics while also seeing what a dirty, degrading business it is. And most of us still have a lingering belief that every choice, even every political choice, is between good and evil, and that if a thing is necessary it is also right. We should, I think, get rid of this belief, which belongs to the nursery. In politics one can never do more than decide which of two evils is the lesser, and there are some situations from which one can only escape by acting like a devil or a lunatic.<br/><br/>It is difficult to see how Gandhi’s methods could be applied in a country where opponents of the régime disappear in the middle of the night and are never heard of again. Without a free press and the right of assembly, it is impossible not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary. Is there a Gandhi in Russia at this moment? And if there is, what is he accomplishing?",,,1,,,0,,,,,

(For more discussion on this weird development, see Byung-Chul Han's Psychopolitik, or Fromm's Sane Society).<br/><br/>One famous example is Elon Musk, who seems to flip-flop between being publicly.... weird, and telling people that you need to work more than 80 hours per week, like him. I guess there's a strong link between both. A lot of the modern Internet startup culture is like this - work yourself to the bone in hope of eventual riches (spoiler: someone else is getting rich). As a scientist there's a similar streak in our work culture, except that nobody is getting rich - and I've seen similar things in the medical profession.<br/><br/>Jason Fried and David Hanemeier Hansson (DHH) both co-founded Basecamp (formerly 37signals?), an Internet company that posits itself as a 'calm company', a place where everybody works 40 hours at the most, a company which doesn't try to grow at all costs. That's what this manifesto is about, essentially a 'modern work culture is BS', followed by 'this is how we are doing this' points, all in short chapters.<br/><br/>Some stuff you want to print out and glue to people's heads:<br/><blockquote><br/>Time-management hacks, life hacks, sleep hacks, work hacks. These all reflect an obsession with trying to squeeze more time out of the day, but rearranging your daily patterns to find more time for work isn’t the problem. Too much shit to do is the problem. The only way to get more done is to have less to do. Saying no is the only way to claw back time. Don’t shuffle 12 things so that you can do them in a different order, don’t set timers to move on from this or that. Eliminate 7 of the 12 things, and you’ll have time left for the 5. It’s not time management, it’s obligation elimination. Everything else is snake oil.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>a lot of the other stuff feels more like advertising for working at Basecamp. Yes, I know this worked for you very well and it took a lot of pressure from your employees, but it's one of many possible solutions. Without numbers or research I cannot tell whether this particular solution is 'better' (for example, yes, 40 hours makes for happier employees, and working longer than that is likely to be detrimental to the work itself - but how much detrimental is it, is it even detrimental, and what about 50, 60, 70 hours, where does it get worse? I don't think there are numbers out there for this?)<br/><br/>But anyway, I'm hoping that this and similar books will cause a re-thinking as to how people treat their work, and their workplace, and their employees. This is one of those books that you should buy a few copies of, then leave them around for someone to serendipitously find. Not just in the business world, but also in scientific research.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

One of the main points of their party program was to split Germany up into Zones:<br/><br/><ul><br/><li> Sichere Beschäftigungs-Zonen (Secure Work Zones), where everybody who wants to work can work, </li><br/><li> Asoziale Parasiten-Zonen (antisocial parasite zones), where those unwilling to work can just do whatever, </li><br/><li> Gewalt-Erlebnis-Parks (violence experience parks), where Nazis and police can beat each other up </li><br/></ul><br/><br/>In Smith's 1998 novel Only Forward, the APPD's Zones have made it into the far future City. City covers most of earth, and was at some point split up into Neighbourhoods. Each Neighbourhood is special for something - there's the cat neighbourhood, a strangely clean place where humans are not allowed to stay, but all cats are welcome - there's Color, where artificial intelligence controls the colours of all walls and fines people for not blending in, the Neighbourhood in which our novel's hero Stark lives - there's Red, a violent zone full of bars, brothels, and violence, straight out of a Jack Womack novel, or a Robocop comic from the 90s:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It's always kind of a tense moment, sticking your head into a bar in Red Neighbourhood. You can take it as a given that there'll be a fight in progress, but it's less easy to predict what kind. Will it be fists, guns or chemical weapons that are involved? Is it a personal battle or a complete free-for-all? The fight in Ji's was a very minor one of the knife variety, which made it feel like a church in spite of the grotesquely loud trash rock exploding out of the speakers.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's a neighbourhood full of workaholics, where the story starts, as it seems one of their important higher-ups has disappeared. From there the book develops into some kind of noir SF book with a ton of humor:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I reached the Department of Doing Things Especially Quickly just before 9.00 p.m. The elevator was now reciting the history of the Department the way it was supposed to, which made me glum until I realised it was making up all of the dates. <br/>'Way to go,' I whispered to it as I got out. 'Fight 'em from within.' <br/>'Right on' it whispered back.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Stark is hired to find an Actioneer who disappeared from his neighbourhood, something which has never happened before, and it looks like the Actioneer disappeared into a completely locked off neighbourhood for an unknown reason - there's a potentially sinister conspiracy, lots of gunfights, The One Who Got Away, potential solves, travel through neighbourhoods, drugs, a snarky hardboiled narrator -<br/><br/>It reminds me of classics such as Lethem's <i>Gun, With Occasional Music</i>, or Lem's <i>Futurological Congress</i>, or Morgan's <i>Altered Carbon</i>, or Womack's <i>Random Acts of Senseless Violence</i>, even a little bit of PKD's <i>The Penultimate Truth</i> (all amazingly fun books you should read!!) -<br/><br/>then, in the middle, the book makes the most amazing turn and just goes <i>OK I got bored of this genre let's do completely something different</i>, a turn that first made me think that the author put the book aside for a few months and then forgot what he was writing about - but that turn is pulled off so well, and it fits in with all the foreshadowing and the story's solution like the long 4-piece in Tetris after a drought of s-pieces, it's a joy to read!<br/><br/>recommended for:<br/>SF-fans, people who like to read books that try to do something different, crime fans",,,1,,,0,,,,,

1440324,"The Vaccinators: Smallpox, Medical Knowledge, and the 'Opening' of Japan",Ann Jannetta,"Jannetta, Ann",,"=""0804754896""","=""9780804754897""",4,3.71,Stanford University Press,Hardcover,264,2007,2007,,2018/09/24,"japan, history, history-of-biology, non-fiction","japan (#29), history (#13), history-of-biology (#3), non-fiction (#157)",read,"<blockquote><br/>Focusing on the activities of a generation of physicians who took up the practice of Western medicine and mobilized support for Jennerian vaccination, this book claims that the process of importing this new technology, exceedingly slow and fraught with difficulties, created a new social and intellectual elite during the first half of the nineteenth century. This new elite comprised groups that operated first at the far periphery of Tokugawa society—rangaku scholars, ranpō physicians, and Dutch interpreters. It survived the fall of the Tokugawa house to take a central role in creating the political, social, and intellectual infrastructure of the modern Japanese state.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What an interesting story - it details how the smallpox/cowpox vaccine made its way to Japan starting from Edward Jenner's discovery to the establishment of a government-wide (federal) vaccination policy. So much to learn!<br/><br/>- Jenner's vaccination trials where he gave cowpox to children, then infected them with smallpox weren't as risky as I always thought. Most people in the country-side were aware of the cowpox/smallpox link. Variolation, the practice with which you infect kids with smallpox when they're the healthiest, was extremely common, so Jenner's trials weren't much of an addition.<br/><br/>- Getting cowpox for vaccinations to Japan was surprisingly hard. The virus doesn't survive heat very well, and doesn't survive very long in scabs. The solution was very fun - they'd infect a child with cowpox, then let the virus replicate in the body while the minor disease runs its course, after 8 days is the ideal time to take out new cowpox viruses and transfer to the next child. Ships would take a handful of children, vaccinate the first, wait 8 days, vaccinate the second, wait 8 days, vaccinate the third, and so on, until the ship was at its destination, where the 'last' child became the cowpox source for the destination.<br/><br/>- The biggest driver of vaccinations in colonies was the Catholic Church!<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>To insure compliance in the Spanish colonies, the Catholic Church would play a major role. When an infant was baptized, the priest would require the godparents to return within six months to have the child vaccinated, offer an indulgence authorized by the Pope, and have a physician or priest record the child’s vaccination in a special parish registry. Bishops would inspect parish records during diocesan visits, and other colonial officials would encourage the acceptance of vaccination by both example and decree. Each Audiencia would require priests to submit an annual report on the progress of immunization in each parish, which the Audiencia could then report to the king.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>How interesting!<br/><br/>- Japan's borders to the world were closed off at this time, which is why it took more than 50 years from Jenner's experiments until a proper vaccination scheme worked in Japan. This transformation was driven by Dutch (and one German) doctors working with Japanese doctors around Nagasaki, followed by the Japanese doctors building an amazing nation-wide information network (which survived some political persecution and executions when the German acquired an illegal map of Japan). This network is credited with being the birth of Japanese universities, with some universities directly tracing their ancestry back to vaccination clinics.<br/><br/>The book itself is aimed at historians/academic/laypeople with a strong interest, I think, just look at this sentence:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The Taki family was adamantly opposed to Western-style medicine, and was largely responsible for the escalating prohibitions against its practice in the 1840s. Taki Motokata and Tsujimoto Shōan had administered the Igakkan at that time, and their deaths in the early months of 1857 suggested that a major source of bakufu opposition to vaccination had been removed.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>In a pop-history book this sentence would <i>not</i> survive an editor.<br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>????????????????????????????",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Some stories are success stories (Witcher 3), some are failures (Star Wars 1313, cancelled when Disney bought Lucasarts).<br/><br/>What struck me was how little planning or governance these companies are doing. These people aren't amateurs, their games make more money than the biggest movies, yet they flounder around and chaos reigns. A lot of that <i>must</i> have been visible early - here for example Schreier describes the chaotic process in which Destiny was developed, people must have known that the first version of the story was complete garbage, yet it was only changed at the very end of the development process. Absolutely no planning, some of that is understandable - as Schreier writes, it's very hard to predict whether a game will be fun, so you have to iterate a lot, but still - at some point the industry should have become better at predicting how good their game is going to be? <br/><br/>Funny enough, the one game that reads like it was actually well-planned came from the industry outsiders from Poland, Witcher 3.<br/><br/>In the programming community, games development is a notoriously terrible area to work in, with constant crunch and death marches.

In fact, the 2008 Egyptian food riots were directly linked to a spike in food prices caused by newly-unfettered commodities trading! Then there's an increased pressure on food prices due to farms growing crops for Biodiesel, not for food - about 13-15% of US farm land goes into car tanks, with a tendency to grow even more. <br/><br/>Depressing, isn't it? And this problem is not going to go away. Malthus features prominently in the introduction for a reason.<br/><br/>The second part is about potential solutions - aquaculture farming, GM technology, organic farming (much more positive than I see it - but ah well, more to re-consider!), vegetarianism, new farm land (especially in the Ukraine), etc., each possible part of the solution one chapter. With one outlook chapter at the end - again reconsidering Malthus, and hoping that increased education programs will bring birthrates down, as they already have in some countries.

It means, for instance, that Bourne misses a chance to talk more about sex. A book inspired by Malthus really ought to have more discussion about his hopes for “restraint” to tame population growth.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Isn't that what the entire last chapter is about?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Bourne tells the history like this: “Better seeds, combined with more fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation, enabled farmers to grow more crop from each acre. Farmers grew so much extra food during the 1960s that they actually helped alleviate global poverty by making food cheaper in most places around the world. The change was so dramatic it was dubbed the ‘green revolution.’ ”<br/><br/>Which isn’t quite right. The man who coined the term “green revolution” was William Gaud, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development in 1968.

Someone on the 'right' will say that Indigenous Australians were lucky that the British colonisers arrived, they weren't using the land and without the British they would have lived in the dirt forever. Someone on the 'left' will say that Indigenous Australians were peaceful children of the earth, living in harmony off the land, taking what was needed and not changing anything. Of course, I exaggerate, but the 'right' story above is close to what's being taught in schools here.<br/><br/>What Pascoe is trying to do here is to reevaluate all the evidence there is on pre-white Indigenous society. He looks at explorers' notes and diaries, shows how their preconceptions and their racism made indigenous buildings, installations, traps etc. 'invisible' to them - for example, food storage buildings were interpreted to be natural formations. From there it followed that Australia was terra nullius, an empty unused country with a bunch of hunter/gatherers running around. Terra nullius was overturned in <i>1992</i>, and the concept itself is still widely accepted (again, see above).<br/><br/>That 'hunter/gatherer' tag is what Pascoe is trying to overturn using this book, and for that he looks at numerous aspects of Indigenous Australian history. There's farming, aquaculture (fish traps), housing/architecture, storage, fire, spirituality, and law, and from there, how Australia's future could be shaped in light of this knowledge.<br/><br/>I work in plant breeding and this has given me dozens of ideas for future research - it will be so interesting to look for patterns of artificial selection in the yam daisy (<i>Microsceris lanceolata</i>), for example - did Indigenous Australians have a breeding program, can we find evidence of that in the genome? Australian food culture is a strange thing, imported Western European food, not much local food (bar the occasional kangaroo sausage or steak). It is hard to farm Western staple crops in Australia, but that is still what the large majority of farmers are doing (see <a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-45179181'>BBC</a> a few days ago).<br/>Australian native plants are seen not as a source of nourishment, but as an occasional source of novelty. So much to change!<br/><br/>I think this is one of the most important books to come out of Australia, and if you're at all interested in this country then you should go and read it. The tone isn't dark in anyway, but taken together, it makes for a depressing read - so much knowledge has been lost.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If we can reform our view of how Aboriginal people were managing the national economy prior to colonisation, it could lead us to reform the ways we currently use resources and care for the land. Imagine turning our focus to the exploitation of meat-producing animals indigenous to the country. Imagine freeing ourselves from the overuse of superphosphates, herbicides and drenches, freeing ourselves from the need of fences and instead experimenting with grazing indigenous animals and growing indigenous crops.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>[...]<br/><blockquote><br/>It seems improbable that a country can continue to hide from the actuality of its history in order to validate the fact that having said sorry we refuse to say thanks. Should we ever decide to say thanks, the next step on a moral nation’s agenda is to ensure that every Australian acknowledges the history and insists that, as we are all Australians, we should have the opportunity to share the education, health and employment of that country on equal terms. Many will say that equality is insufficient to account for the loss of the land but in our current predicament it is not a bad place to start.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>If there's one thing that's to be criticised - Pascoe tries to overturn <i>all</i> aspects of thought on Indigenous Australians, so that the book becomes sometimes a bit muddled.

But then where to go from there? To Shields, you should take non-fiction, and take that to the end, since fiction is a lie that everybody knows is a lie ('It feels like driving a car in a clown suit. You’re going somewhere, but you’re in costume, and you’re not really fooling anybody.

The first part, my favorite, reminds me strongly of Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Instead of Kahneman's two systems to interpret (economic?) reality, Haidt has two systems with which we make morale decisions with. One is the elephant, the auto-pilot, one is the elephant's rider, who can be slowly influenced.  That's the most interesting part to me: our moral reactions are often not based on rational thought, but on knee-jerk reactions which we then rationalise post-hoc. We constantly lie to ourselves and we don't even realise that! <br/><br/>This has so many implications for anyone doing any science-related outreach. A lot of the 'pro-GM' stuff I see works on a purely rational level, while the 'anti-GM' stuff works on an emotional level. In Haidt's system, the pro-people talk to the rider, the anti-people talk to the elephant. Often the anti-people win because the elephant is the predominant system which works 'automatically'. Working around these two systems is something science outreach should seriously look at!<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>People bind themselves into political teams that share moral narratives. Once they accept a particular narrative, they become blind to alternative moral worlds.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When does the elephant listen to reason? The main way that we change our minds on moral issues is by interacting with other people. We are terrible at seeking evidence that challenges our own beliefs, but other people do us this favor, just as we are quite good at finding errors in other people’s beliefs. When discussions are hostile, the odds of change are slight. The elephant leans away from the opponent, and the rider works frantically to rebut the opponent’s charges. But if there is affection, admiration, or a desire to please the other person, then the elephant leans toward that person and the rider tries to find the truth in the other person’s arguments.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>There's a great critique of new atheists like Dawkins and whatnot their names are, in that they all focus their critiques on the wrong stuff. To Haidt, <i>any</i> religious system is at its core believing into something illogical, but that's not the point of the system at all. The system is there to create and strengthen group ties, what the group actually believes in is secondary. I have to say, I agree with that, and it mirrors a lot of what I find uncomfortable with the lesswrong crowd:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I concluded by warning that the worship of reason, which is sometimes found in philosophical and scientific circles, is a delusion. It is an example of faith in something that does not exist. I urged instead a more intuitionist approach to morality and moral education, one that is more humble about the abilities of individuals [...]<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The rest of the book is not so interesting to me - Haidt goes on to find several moral 'foundations' or 'frameworks' in human societies, and some societies put different levels of values onto those moral systems (a system like 'individualistic rights', or 'sacredness', 'Care', 'Fairness' etc. pp.). That part is OK - but then he finds the need to explain all of this using <i>group selection</i> of all things! Haidt seems to believe that group selection is necessary to explain his foundations (groups that work better, have higher cohesion, etc. out-compete other groups), but honestly, most of that you can 'explain away' using a variant of Fisher's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexy_son_hypothesis'>Sexy son hypothesis</a>. People who fit better into their in-group will have children who fit better, so their children will have higher reproductive success within the group. People who fit into the group will have higher reproductive success than people outside of the group, and so on. If you imagine that there's a gene which makes you fit better into the group you can argue entirely on the level of the individual (I believe :) ). No need for group selection!<br/><br/>The other part I disliked is due to me not being US-American. There's a large part where Haidt writes about what distinguishes the 'left' from the 'right' - he says that he makes that distinction because that's how most of the research literature describes it, which I guess means I'm sceptical of the research literature itself, I guess? What counts for 'left' in the US is almost 'centre right' in Europe, so I'm unsure how universal the literature truly is.<br/><br/>(Can Haidt's system explain the weird support Trump receives within the US? The book came out before the current schlamassel, so Haidt doesn't refer to Trump. Haidt often writes about in-group morality and how that keeps the group stable etc., but so far Trump has broken all of those rules and no bad outcome has materialised!)<br/><br/><br/>P.S.: Thinking, Fast and Slow was hit by the reproducibility crisis - many studies use very few participants, which means that by the law of statistics you're bound to see more extreme events. If you want to know whether a coin is fair, you want to flip it often and measure how often heads and tail comes up. If you flip it ten times and it comes up 9 times heads, is it biased? You saw an extreme event happen, but only because you measured so few flips. It gets more even after 100 or even 1000 flips, so you need a larger sample size. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, many studies fail to reproduce, with more participants the same findings do not materialise. Sometimes Haidt mentions the sample size and it's <i>always</i> cause for concern (""Greene brought eighteen subjects into an fMRI scanner and presented each of his stories on the screen""). Some people have looked at the studies cited by Kahneman and found them not to reproduce, I wonder how many of Haidt's cited studies will have the same problem.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Over time people found many 'tricks' which are not explainable, but they just make your model work better. Some of that 'folk wisdom' here is a bit explainable - for example, there's a great summary which activation and loss function to use when, and when to use which architecture - some are less explainable, and that's what makes this book so useful.

You get a ton of thoughts ranging from a few sentences to a few pages; the best part being that you can see how cleanly Nietzsche develops a thought over a few inter-connected aphorism (and then comes back to it later, only to refute it). It's like reading through Nietzsche's process of thought.<br/><br/>You can see that there's almost ten years between both books; the second half is more mature, has less jokes, but is sometimes more cryptic and harder to interpret, but still, much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>There are some recurring themes that are worth going through -<br/><br/>1) The dream of Europe. Quite often he praises the European idea, of having many nations come together as ""cantons"" into one network of states. To him Europe has a specific goal and task:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Desshalb muss jetzt ein Jeder, der gut europäisch gesinnt ist, gut und immer besser schreiben lernen: es hilft Nichts, und wenn er selbst in Deutschland geboren ist, wo man das schlecht-Schreiben als nationales Vorrecht behandelt. Besser schreiben aber heisst zugleich auch besser denken; immer Mittheilenswertheres erfinden und es wirklich mittheilen können; übersetzbar werden für die Sprachen der Nachbarn; zugänglich sich dem Verständnisse jener Ausländer machen, welche unsere Sprache lernen; dahin wirken, dass alles Gute Gemeingut werde und den Freien Alles frei stehe; endlich, jenen jetzt noch so fernen Zustand der Dinge vorbereiten, wo den guten Europäern ihre grosse Aufgabe in die Hände fällt: die Leitung und Ueberwachung der gesammten Erdcultur.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translation:<br/><blockquote><br/>That's why anybody who's European-minded has to learn to write well and always better - it doesn't help when he's born in Germany, where ""bad-writing"" is treated as national privilege. To write better means to think better; to come up with things worthy of communication, and to communicate them; to become translatable for the languages of the neighbors; to become accessible to those foreigners who learn our language; work towards that all good becomes common good and that the free are free to everything; finally, to prepare this now so distant state of affairs, where the good Europeans have their grand task at hand: the management and supervision of earth's culture. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>You'd like to see that in the EU, wouldn't you? So far all we've done is to misinterpret ""supervision of earth's culture"" as ""let's start Five Eyes, build Echelon and spy on everybody""<br/><br/>2) Critical thought - you should change your opinions, you shouldn't trust anyone, you should be critical towards every thought. You change your clothes regularly, so why don't you do the same with your opinions?<br/><br/>3) There's a very smart part about how much of a self-defeating thing it is that countries are keeping armies ""solely for defense purposes"", as that implies that only the neighbors are the ""bad"" guys and oneself has nothing but ""good"" thoughts, culminating in:<br/><br/> <blockquote>Lieber zu Grunde gehen, als hassen und fürchten, und zweimal lieber zu Grunde gehen, als sich hassen und fürchten machen, — diess muss einmal auch die oberste Maxime jeder einzelnen staatlichen Gesellschaft werden!</blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation:<br/><br/><blockquote>It's better to collapse than to hate and fear, and it's better to collapse twice than to make yourself hated and feared - some day this has to be the topmost maxim of every society!</blockquote><br/><br/>I'm reminded of the recent reactions to Daesh.<br/><br/>4) On e-mails: <br/><br/><blockquote>Der Brief ist ein unangemeldeter Besuch, der Briefbote der Vermittler unhöflicher Ueberfälle. Man sollte alle acht Tage eine Stunde zum Briefempfangen haben und darnach ein Bad nehmen.</blockquote><br/><br/>Transl.<br/><br/><blockquote>The letter is an unannounced visit, the postman the agent of a rude invasion. Every 8 days you should have an hour to receive letters and then you should take a bath.</blockquote><br/><br/>5) On gender there's quite a lot of outdated thought but at least he ""saves himself"" by stating that this is due to the state of society and not due to some inherent difference:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Man kann in den drei oder vier civilisirten Ländern Europa’s aus den Frauen durch einige Jahrhunderte von Erziehung Alles machen, was man will, selbst Männer, freilich nicht in geschlechtlichem Sinne, aber doch in jedem anderen Sinne.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In the three or four civilized countries Europe's you can use education to make anything out of women in a few centuries, even men, of course not in the biological/bodily sense, but in any other sense.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>6) The Greeks, Goethe, and arts - Nietzsche has some very strong opinions on art, and sees the Greeks as the biggest humans who ever lived, with only Goethe having come close to their genius (""Goethe was above the Germans and still is above them - he will never belong to them"")<br/><br/>Of course you don't have to agree with anything he states (and a lot of it is outdated and sometimes weird) but it's still a wealth of information to learn, and I assume a good starting point to Nietzsche's thought in general, or as a manual on ""how to structure your thoughts"".",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It is a stuffed doll with yellow yarn for hair and two Xs for eyes and a line for a mouth. It is called a Dammit Doll. I am to grasp this doll by the legs and whack the stuffing out of it, while shouting, Dammit, dammit, dammit. I try, but the doll has proven to be made from industrial-grade stuff. I have named it Science, You Motherfucker.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I found this on a few lists on 'sciency summer-reads' so I gave it a go. It's <i>not really</i> a book about life in science, such as Arrowsmith. Science as a profession is only prevalent at the start (and what garbage supervisors, for so many reasons!), but the focus is much more on the inner world of the unnamed narrator. The narrator has a breakdown or a depressive episode triggered by a failing PhD, the breakdown and subsequent glimmer of hope is what forms the novel.<br/><br/>It's wonderfully subtle, the language is bare-bones, and again and again: broken child-parent relationships, broken parents, overbearing culture.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>My mother asks: When are you finishing your doctorate? When are you getting a job?<br/>My father asks: When are you paying back your student loans? When are you buying a house?<br/>They both agree that I should stop being a child and start being an adult.<br/>In college, I had a Chinese roommate who called her parents every Sunday.<br/>In college, I had a Chinese roommate who cried for two hours every Sunday.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Other characters, described in similarly dry ways, are as broken as the narrator, but that's up to the reader to see. Among this oppression there is hope, however - understanding dawns for the mother, empathy grows in the narrator, change is possible. Great book!<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The Chinese word for chemistry is <i>hua xue</i>. The first character means to change, transform, melt. The second character means to learn. Said with a different inflection, <i>xue</i> could mean snow, <i>hua</I> could mean speech and chemistry becomes the melting of snow, becomes the learning of speech.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Since this is reality, there is no 'red thread' going through the book - people appear, they disappear, they reappear, most of the time they die.<br/><br/>The major theme of the novel is brutality, so if you can't stomach that, stay away. In this book the Russian army has a pecking order based on sheer brutality, the new ones get beaten up by the old ones, the higher rungs beat up the lower ones, etc. - and not just a slap, but kicks in the face until teeth fall out, every night. Chechen warriors disembowel captured Russians, or publicly slit their throats. People get blown up, so that only a foot is sent home in a zinc coffin, welded shut. Mothers of missing soldiers are accidentally shot - they've come to Chechnya to find their sons, since the chaotic Russian army can't really keep track of anything. Deserters run away? Eh, so what, they'll die anyway. Newcomers steal some ammunition? The officers get drunk, beat up the newcomers brutally over days, mock-execute them, until they kick them out naked into Chechnya; left to die.<br/><br/>I can't really understand the comparison to Catch-22 in Goodreads' description - Catch-22 was an over-the-top satire which took many freedoms to get the point across, One Soldier's War is just nihilist brutality from start to end.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

So good I read it in two nights, each night until 4am. You think it can't get worse, but then the story turns around and turns more weird and dodgy!<br/><br/>If you're following biotechnology then you'll have heard of Theranos, a fancy startup with <i>tons</i> of funding and a ridiculously star-studded board of directors (Henry Kissinger??), run by the very young and rich Elizabeth Holmes. Theranos promised the world (almost all blood tests with a prick of your finger, at home!) and delivered nothing, while actively cheating (many fingerprick blood results were diluted with water to get the required volume to run on commercial machines, which made the results wildly unpredictable).<br/><br/>This book comes from John Carreyrou, who was the first reporter who reported on Theranos' dodgy practices. It's essentially a summary of everything at Theranos that led up to Carreyrou's involvement and ends with a first-person account of Carreyrou's articles, the immense pressure from Theranos' lawyers, and finally the closure of the company with indictments of some of those involved.<br/><br/>What makes this story 'universal' for our times is that it's not about blood testing, but about how the most powerful entities right now (Silicon Valley elites) see the world, and themselves. Holmes (who stays an enigma in the book - she declined interviews) saw herself, like so much of Silicon Valley self-hype, as someone who was helping the world become healthy and change things for everybody!  Instead she and her colleagues (foremost Ramesh Sunny Balwani) kept on lying to investors and to the press, making up ridiculous valuations, inventing machines that didn't work. Since Holmes' family was so well-connected she got half of the US elite on-board which made naysayers think twice. If Henry Kissinger is on board, then why would this be dodgy?<br/><br/>As a German I want to believe that a story as wild as this cannot happen outside of the US. The regulatory entities (FDA etc.) don't come off very well here, as Theranos was running tests for supermarket chains with minimal or no government oversight at all! Furthermore Theranos hired extremely expensive lawyers who in turn worked with private detectives to try and sue any source of Carreyrou for breach of contract or other invented reasons, it's infuriating to read that. Note to self: If you want lawyers to <i>really</i> bite on your behalf, pay them in company shares instead of cash.<br/><br/>One of the most depressing outcomes of this story is the suicide of Ian Gibbons, chief scientist, who was supposed to testify in a patent troll case (Carreyrou doesn't call it a patent troll case but to me it's pure rent seeking, essentially a frenemy of the Holmes family read up on Theranos' ideas, added a small science-fiction-based feature to the Theranos idea, and patented that idea, no prototype was made). The problem was that all of the Theranos patents had Elizabeth Holmes listed as first author, but she had no training or experience in the field, so they put her on there for publicity reasons. This makes the patents invalid. But Gibbons was too old to testify about that and risk getting fired, so after a depressive episode he killed himself. I always thought the entire Theranos story was wacky and a symbol of US hubris, I had no idea it ended in at least one death.<br/><br/>I wonder for how long Holmes and Sunny go to prison?<br/><br/>P. S.: I absolutely loathe Rupert Murdoch, but I learned that here Murdoch actually did something <i>good</i>! Murdoch was one of the investors of Theranos but also Carreyrou's boss' boss. Holmes met with Murdoch <i>four</i> times and tried to get him to stop Carreyrou's investigations, which he always declined. That man has morals?!?<br/><br/>P.P.S.: So much typical Silicon Valley hubris - 'We're here to make the world a better place!', then uses the income to buy a private jet. Perhaps it's necessary to tell yourself these good-sounding lies.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Kauztum), a good German word. It comes from the old word for owl (Kauz), and is a kind word used to describe someone who has devoted their life to something 99.99% of people see no meaning in. A Kauz is the weird old professor every uni has and no student knows what they're even doing (prime example: <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/magazine/the-strange-case-of-the-missing-joyce-scholar.html'>John Kidd</a>.)<br/><br/>Some of DeWitt's characters are such Käuze, they love knowledge and not much else. However that makes some of these stories feel unfinished. You can't do much 'traditional' story with such characters, they can't develop much. They appear in love with knowledge, say their bit, and disappear with their love. Sometimes that love can feel snooty, but often, when it gets <i>too</i> snooty a touch of irony breaks it:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>‘The thing that interests me,’ I say. ‘One of the things that interest me is the way there is this emphasis on inserting the body of the writer into the scene, as if making a connection between this physical presence and the <i>derniers mots</i> will somehow make these specially valid. Look at Noyes.’ I pick up the book.<br/>‘“We must obviously not picture him here with the ‘eternal grin’ of Mr Lytton Strachey, but with the blood-stained rag at his lips, and eyes that had been looking into the face of Death. Those eyes are turned for a moment, with the curious wonder which is a sick man’s only way of reproach, upon a secretary who is trying to defeat a purpose definitely decided upon before this illness occurred.”<br/>‘The blood-stained rag,’ I say, ‘says this is real and true. The document is genuine. Its statements may be <i>attached</i> to Voltaire.’<br/>X is flipping through Pomeau.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This also must be the first book I read that featured R-code. Several 'greats' of the R programming language are mentioned by name (Hadley Wickham etc), there's actual R-code with a few plots, some characters fight about white-space vs. tab (of the many boring fights 'nerds' have, this is one of the most boring), data pervades some, but not all of these stories.<br/><br/>Favourite story: Entourage, about a rich man (Kauz again!) who travels with suitcases full of books, each book carried by someone who spoke the language the books in their suitcase were written in. Just look at those two quotes:<br/><blockquote><br/>It was now unexpectedly necessary to purchase a small suitcase and fill it with books replete with the letters z, w, y, j and k. It was necessary to hire someone to fly with him to Berlin to accompany the suitcase. Słowosław was the applicant whose name had the best letters.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>(He had been entranced to discover that the Russian for Protopope was Протопоп.)<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Aaaaah, <i>nice</i>. Still, The Last Samurai struck me deeper. But then again, at least two stories tell you how good Stanislaw Lem's Robotermärchen are, and that alone makes this a recommendation.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I guess he did everything he wanted there, so he tried his hand at crime fiction, noir fiction to be precise! He clearly did his homework as many of the noir tropes are there.<br/><br/>- main character who constantly gets beaten up (remember Chinatown?)<br/><br/>- brutal main character with a chequered and violent past, but ultimately with a heart of gold (Byronic Hero? <a href='https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor'>Knight In Sour Armor</a>?)<br/><br/>- SPOILER <spoiler>an end twist that makes many of the prior actions unnecessary </spoiler><br/><br/>- dirty cops, with lots of police brutality<br/><br/>- lots of mafia, including the main character<br/><br/>- every man drinks hard alcohol and nothing else<br/><br/>- a dying town. This, by the way, is the only part where Barron really falls back into a weird fiction description, the rest of the book is clearly delineated from weird fiction - so completely that it feels like Barron could've adopted a different author name, like Ian Banks a.k.a Ian M. Banks used to do.<br/><br/>The only problem is that not much is being developed past these tropes, it's (mostly!) familiar water if you've read some noir crime novels. It feels like Barron is more testing the water, trying to develop away from weird fiction, seeing whether he can pull off writing an entire novel in a genre he has not much experience with. It clearly works for the reader looking for a crime novel (even though sometimes the language used is too much 'american tough guy' cliche for me), but don't come expecting a) weird fiction, or noir mixed with weird fiction or b) a truly original noir novel. Maybe the next one in the series will allow for more experimentation now that Barron has become more comfortable with the genre?<br/><br/>It is the task of the artist to develop, and the task of the audience to follow along.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's like [b:The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles|1319|The War of Art  Break Through the Blocks & Win Your Inner Creative Battles|Steven Pressfield|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388176109s/1319.jpg|722104] but without the weird cancer victim-blaming, and with more of an introspective, self-reflection vibe going on.<br/><br/>There's so much mature, smart stuff here:<br/><br/>Especially in a hyperconnected world you cannot stop 'stealing' from others, it's impossible to remember whether an idea you had is novel or whether you saw it on Twitter late at night 2 years ago. That's not a bad thing, but you have to develop from there, you have to curate your inner space. You have to let some things in and purposely leave some things out.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Creative people need to start thinking of themselves a little differently. Now, in the twenty-first century, creative life also includes some management of other people’s creativity and the overlap between yours and theirs. To put it a different way: you can be an artist, but you also have to be a curator. You have to occupy both of these roles at the same time.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I find that very interesting, and it reminded me of Kobo Abe/Haruki Murakami. I think part of the reason Murakami is so popular in 'Western' audiences is that there is no point of reference, no similar author. However I'm convinced that Murakami 'took' a lot from Kobo Abe (who I only discovered because once I thought I'll read the whole public library in Muenster starting from A - I gave up at Chinua Achebe because the glue of the books smelled weird). That's not a bad thing, that's how art works, but it's great luck for Murakami that Abe is so unknown (get [b:The Box Man|9999|The Box Man|Kōbō Abe|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320459929s/9999.jpg|58327]!), it makes Murakami stand out more. I wonder how many other authors stand out in a similar way (just think of Umberto Eco and his neverending knowledge of books!)<br/><br/><br/>There's so much other cool stuff, like this quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Protocreativity? Prepackaging? Whatever it is, it can be useful. If you’re a writer, imagine the blurbs that will be on the paperback. If you’re a painter, imagine what people will say when they’re standing in front of your canvas. This is another example of being present but not-present: you are the creator but also the eventual audience. When you’re on the outside of your own work looking in, you’ll be able to see the overall shape of it, which will help you to realize that you’re on the right track (or, alternatively, that you’re not).<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The best scientists' talks I've seen were clearly thought out in a similar way. I've seen the greats finish their talks, take questions, say 'ah yes!' and show a few more slides they prepared in advance, slides which didn't fit with the story they wanted to tell, but slides which answered the audience question <i>perfectly</i>. That always leaves me in awe. (Questlove has a similar story where he expected that someone on the Internet will claim that his drums on a record weren't played live and weren't played through, so he put in a tiny fill at a particular position so he could point any future naysayer to that second! that is so cool)<br/><br/>Questlove is  not a fan of artists who present themselves as 'pure', outside of any commercial interest. He lists a few points where commercial interests are the drivers of the art, without it the art would've never been made (the deadline!). I'm reminded of Douglas Adams, who would've never finished The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy without the BBC's deadlines, famously writing scenes for the radio play while the previous scene was being recorded in the next room over. In science it's very similar, the majority of scientists (I believe) need a structure around them, they need a goal to work towards. Nowadays it's the paper, the publication, in the past, it was the public presentation. I think that the focus on papers is one of the drivers of a faster scientific progress, but that's hard to prove (the professional scientist is a very recent invention too, and now there's so many more compared to Darwin's time!)<br/><br/>One great example you should probably read is Mlodinow's [b:Feynman's Rainbow: A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life|45776|Feynman's Rainbow  A Search for Beauty in Physics and in Life|Leonard Mlodinow|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388864700s/45776.jpg|44940], which is more or less exactly about this dichotomy between 'inner drive towards creativity' and 'outside pressures to produce results'. After a highly promising PhD thesis Mlodinow was offered a unique 'do whatever you want' position, which is what the book is about. Without external structure Mlodinow crashed and burned, and eventually left science! I believe that most scientists would've fared similar. That's not to say that wasting years of your life writing grant applications are necessary, but I believe (like Questlove) that this external structure driving you on is (mostly!) necessary.<br/><br/>Another great point Questlove brings up is failure.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>David Bowie said something I really liked. I don’t know if he said it often, but it’s the kind of thing that you should get tattooed on your leg. He said that creativity is “one of the few human endeavors where you can crash your airplane and walk away from it.” Your mistakes don’t have to bring you down, not by any means. But Bowie’s observation has an even deeper level. Creative failures can feel like near-death experiences, and surviving them can create a sense of liberation. [...]Creative failure leads to a similar liberation. When you walk away from your crashed airplane, you’re playing with house money. You can do anything—and hopefully you will. Failure is sometimes in your mind. Sometimes it’s in the eye of the . . . well, not the beholder, exactly, but the afflicted. Even when it’s not, even when it’s indisputable, it’s never the end. [...] true creative people don’t walk away from it, not exactly. They walk toward the next thing.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>How good is that? It works similar in research - one of the things I have to learn as an early career researcher is when to admit defeat, when to kill a project. Sometimes research just doesn't work, you neither proved or falsified the basic hypothesis, nothing makes sense, and I've seen people waste years of their career going down these nowhere paths. The day you kill those projects, the day you kill your darlings you'll feel sad, but also liberated. I think Konrad Lorenz wrote something to the tune that as a researcher, every day before breakfast you should kill your favourite hypothesis, it keeps you young.<br/><br/>Anyway, read this book if you want a warm, mature, kind voice telling you about creativity as a lifelong pursuit, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>P.S.: <br/>Somewhere, Questlove cites a self-motivational letter Michael Jackson wrote to himself when he was starting out on his solo career ('I should be a new, incredible actor/singer/dancer that will shock the world.'). It reminded me of Octavia E. Butler's wonderful letter <a href='https://electricliterature.com/read-octavia-e-butlers-inspiring-message-to-herself-806ba29a13a2'>here</a>, go read it! (Questlove uses this as an example for the necessary 'departures' a creative person makes, to break out of the mould other people see them in)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Interesting are the chapters from the POV of the plant - I don't think plants would think this similar to humans, but they still give a neat view into how this world is constructed, Burke goes to great lengths to show you how the entire ecosystem is interconnected, how the plants are interacting with the animals, other plants, and how they use, coerce and cajole each other.

The letters record the daily life of an ordinary scientist doing ordinary work. I find them interesting because I had the good fortune to live through extraordinary historical times with an extraordinary collection of friends.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Freeman Dyson wrote some of my favourite essays and book reviews, mostly because he has got a way of thinking about things from a very, <i>very</i> big perspective. Luckily there's this new autobiography!<br/><br/>We get Dyson's letters starting in 1941, when he was 17 years old and starting university, and end in 1978, with a near death experience during a mugging, when Dyson was around 55. He is now 94 and still writing essays for NYRB.<br/>These letters are structured like Goethe's [b:The Sorrows of Young Werther|16640|The Sorrows of Young Werther|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386920896s/16640.jpg|746264] - we only get Dyson's letters, the answers from his mother or sister are always omitted. I like that format, as I'm interested in that particular area of history, I wouldn't care too much about Dyson's family's opinions. You need to be acquainted with Dyson's life and the history of physics around 1920-1950 to get the most out of this book; there are many comments in italics by 2016 Dyson explaining some of the names and references, but frequent jumps (some by 6 months or more) make it hard to tease Dyson's life history from these letters.<br/><br/>I don't know much about physics but I know more about the history of physics. <i>All</i> the big names appear here and had contact with Dyson - Feynman features extensively (Dyson paints him in a very positive picture) as does Oppenheimer, Dirac appears, as do Besicovitch, Pars, Hawking, Yukawa, W. T. (Bill) Tutte, Bethe, Teller,  but also amazing non-scientists: Léon Motchane (rich industrialist in the 20s, then member of the French resistance (wounded in action), then PhD in mathematics at the age of 54 (!!!), then used his wealth to found <a href='https://www.ihes.fr/institut/histoire/'>IHES</a>), T.S. Eliot (!!!), Stanley Kubrick, etc.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>- If you're looking for a general intro to 'what it's like to be a scientist', do <i>not</i> go for this book. Dyson lived and worked through a peculiar and unique time in an extremely vibrant environment, that's the 0.0000001% of science. Since then science as profession has become much more streamlined, controlled, and evaluated. Dyson writes about a fellowship he received which included costs for 'a summer of travel' - nowadays that's unthinkable. Produce papers or perish, no time to bum around for a few months.<br/><br/>- I have to read more about Henry Moseley. Dyson credits Moseley for saving Dyson from being drafted: Moseley was a promising physicist who was killed in 1915, after which the British government drafted laws to exempt promising young scientists in any war. There's a whole book possible around what these laws made possible!<br/>  <br/>- Dyson, especially the young Dyson, was amazingly shrewd, self-confident, and clear-sighted. I have no clue how he managed to do that at such a young age (an academic family probably helped in understanding academic political structures), but sentences such as this one show you how well he grasped his situation and position, and how good he was at seeing the big picture:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>During the next five years, there is a gambler’s chance of my doing something substantial in this field, but only if I give it a lot of my time and attention. The important thing is to use this chance while it is here. By the time I am forty, the game will be played out.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>That was in 1948, when Dyson was 25. I know scientists in their 40s who don't understand their position as well as Dyson did back then. Dyson was correct in that this particular field of science quickly 'dried out', bigger and bigger particle accelerators were necessary to get results.<br/><br/>- there are some wonderfully understated short scenes, Dyson got around!<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I had a telephone call from London, a film magnate called Roger Caras asking me to come to his studio to help them with a science fiction film called Encounter 2001. Stanley Kubrick, who directed Dr. Strangelove, is also doing this one.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>FEBRUARY 28, <b>1970</b> I was taking care of Stephen Hawking, a young English astrophysicist who came here for a six-day visit. I had never got to know him till this week. Stephen is a brilliant young man who is now dying in the advanced stages of a paralytic nerve disease. He got the disease when he was twenty-one and he is now twenty-eight, so his whole professional life has been lived under sentence of death.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- there are some concerns which you usually don't find in physics autobiographies. Dyson (quotes as 'having been brought up as a socialist') had an eye for social injustices. There is one letter complaining about the squandered life of a promising African-American scientist (Walter Macafee) who could have done so much more if he wouldn't have needed to work in poverty for most of his life, in 1948, when Dyson was 25:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>He is much older than the rest of us and has the handicap of his lost years. His story is an object lesson in the wastefulness of the discrimination policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I heard King speak in Berkeley about fifteen years ago, before he became famous, and I always had a great belief in him. He was far and away the greatest and most far-sighted of the Negro leaders. I do not blame the negroes at all for rioting now. If I were black, I would be out in the streets with them.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(Apologising note in another letter by 2016-Dyson: 'In those days the word negro was used as African-American is used today.')<br/>There's another wonderful passage where Dyson describes the advances made by Japanese scientists in the 50s and 60s, and how happy he is that some of the Japanese advances anticipated US inventions:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If the scientists can say that even in this chosen field of physics America was anticipated, and indeed by a member of the much-despised race of Japanese, this will be a strong card to play against nationalistic policies.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- a wonderfully dry British humor:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>About ten thousand Princetonians came to watch and got in the way to some extent. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- it's interesting to see how fears can take hold of a society and then drop off completely, even their names forgotten. Dyson lists a prime example in his explanatory notes:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The “European situation” here means the fear that the rising population of Europe would be unable to feed itself. This fear was particularly strong in 1948 in England and in Germany. The expected disaster never happened, partly because birth rates remained lower than expected and partly because the Green Revolution made food production higher than expected.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Have you ever heard of the 'European situation'? I haven't.<br/><br/>- The final few sentences summarise well the kind of thought building Dyson operates in:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[Young people] need to understand why science has failed to give us fair shares and social justice, and they need to work out practical remedies. This is not a job for scientists to do alone. It will need a worldwide collaboration of scientists with economists, political activists, environmentalists, and religious leaders, to lift science and society out of the swamp where we are stuck. Pure science is best driven by intellectual curiosity, but applied science needs also to be driven by ethics.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>Recommended for: people interested in how great minds work, or those who are interested in the history of the <i>Knabenphysik</i>.<br/><br/>not recommended for: people who don't want to put in at least a little effort to first learn this history, or people who are not interested in this (to me!) highly exciting short time in science. I find that time so interesting - I don't think there's any other field of research where one or two decades of a flurry of research by very young people changed everything, it's like reading about a continuous explosion, like watching a 20 year long meteor shower.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Borges could do both, while shaking great authors out of his pockets and creating links between disparate literatures and worlds.<br/><br/>The themes that Borges was writing about in his more famous stories and novellas appear here as well: the difference between maps and their territory (Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius), eternity in time, infinity in space, infinity in text (think The Library Of Babel). So if you're looking for more background to his stories you'll find it here, while he doesn't link directly to his fiction, he makes some essays about the same themes. For example, for the concept a a ouynhe cites and quotes the <br/><br/>What's even more fun here are all the thought experiments that haven't made it into his fiction (at least not as far as I know), some based on theology, some on physics. Borges somehow manages to - for the duration of the essay - truly believe in these concepts, and in turn, make you believe in them. That's the mark of a truly great author.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>These inversions [Quixote being a reader of the book Quixote, Hamlet watching a play based on Hamlet] suggest that if the characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators, we, its readers or spectators, can be fictitious.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>So many other fun thoughts - what if all poems are fragments or episodes of a single infinite poem? What if time were circular, would it matter if art gets lost or destroyed, since all thoughts will be thought again anyway? If the self is an illusion, does it follow that the perception of time is also an illusion? ('... the plan to abolish the past had already occurred to men and - paradoxically - is therefore one of the proofs that the past cannot be abolished. The past is indestructible; sooner or later all things will return, including the plan to abolish the past.' - joy!). Borges cites widely, from French books on Chinese philosophy, from Gaucho literature, to English medieval literature, it's a huge network (if you want to see more of that network, get [b:Professor Borges: A Course on English Literature|16173838|Professor Borges  A Course on English Literature|Jorge Luis Borges|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1353989897s/16173838.jpg|22022667]).<br/><br/>Do you learn anything? Does it matter? Just look at these beautiful thoughts:<br/><blockquote><br/>Literature is not exhaustible, for the sufficient and simple reason that a single book is not. A book is not an isolated entity: it is a narration, an axis of innumerable narrations. One literature differs from another, either before or after it, not so much because of the text as for the manner in which it is read. If I were able to read any contemporary page - this one, for example - as it would be read in the year 2000, I would know what literature would be like in the year 2000.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or this one:<br/><blockquote><br/>Dunne assures us that in death we shall finally learn how to handle eternity. We shall recover all the moments of our lives and combine them as we please. God and our friends and Shakespeare will collaborate with us.<br/>So splendid a thesis, makes any fallacy committed by the author insignificant.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's a pleasure, turns my skin warm.<br/><br/>After some more 'general' essays like these he moves on to literature reviews and to movie reviews. The literature reviews - shorter than the preceding essays - are interesting because again they show how widely and without Borges would read.

All literature (I would dare to answer) is symbolic; there are a few fundamental experiences, and it is unimportant whether a writer, in transmitting them, makes use of the ""fantastic"" or the ""real"", Macbeth or Raskolninov, the invasion of Belgium in August 1914 or an invasion of Mars. What does it matter if it is this novel, or novelty, of science fiction? In this outwardly fantastic book, Bradbury has set out the long empty Sundays, the American tedium, and his own solitude, as Sinclair Lewis did in Main Street.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>The movie reviews are less fun to read, partially because I haven't seen any of those movies from the 20s and 30s, partially because the essays are short, but still interesting to read for a) a takedown of dubbed movies and b) this sentence on the director von Sternberg:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Formerly he seemed mad, which at least was something; now he seems merely simpleminded.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Get this book, read this book, cherish it, love it",,,1,,,0,,,,,

While the 'wave' arrives a few hundred people copy their minds with various hacky VR machines. These people survive as programs who can inhibit, or control?, robots. While the hundreds and thousands of years go past we follow Bartek, one of those 'originals', while various alliances come together and fall apart, trying to use the old knowledge to resurrect life.<br/><br/>It's not an easy read. I can be confusing as the main character is a program never really in 'one' body, which is why the story often jumps (think of Ancillary Justice). It can be even more confusing once the main character obtains a dream module, after that the novel is constantly hallucinating. There's no real motivation or character development or even anything close to a 'character' here, but that is part of the message:<br/><br/>It feels like here there are both kinds of 'Artificial Intelligence' - the 'classic' one, which is a thinking, perhaps reasoning computer, think Asimov's robots. The other is the 'current' one, the one termed machine learning, where you have an algorithm that 'learns' and 'learns' until it overfits to the point of purely imitating what it has been fed, with no power of extrapolating, no chance of originality. In philosophy of mind terms, p-zombies. The kicker in this book is that the 'humans' themselves struggle with this distinction, and it takes them a long time to learn which one they are.<br/><br/>Other fun questions are raised - how would voting in a democracy work if you can copy yourself, and your voice?

Roberts is a military historian, so the focus is definitely on military action, less on other interesting aspects of Napoleon's life like, for example, the specific art style of the Napoleonic era.<br/><br/>The majority of this book's maps are maps of battlefields and positions, the largest part of the text is descriptions of the various battles, which is perhaps unsurprising for a biography of a man who made his name in war. Especially in the last chapter Roberts makes a lot of Napoleon's military background, which I'm sure many won't agree with: <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Much has been written about his Corsicanness, his origins in the petit noblesse, his absorption of the ideas of the Enlightenment, and his inspiration by the ancient world, but the years he spent in military schooling at Brienne and the École Militaire affected him even more than any of these, and it was from the ethos of the Army that he took most of his beliefs and assumptions.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The focus on war is the trick that makes book so fast-paced, the battles are almost described like sports matches with tactic errors and routes and whatnot, you almost (almost!) forget that every time Napoleon stirred 100,000 Europeans had to die. <br/><br/>Roberts' viewpoint is, let's say, conciliatory - he likes to look at instances where history judged Napoleon harshly and tries to defend Napoleon, often by assuming the most positive view ('Yes, Napoleon wrote this error in his letter, but he was probably betting on it being intercepted, thereby confusing the English!', or, 'an overzealous underling probably did that', and so on), sometimes by painting other politicians in a worse light ('[Napoleon] cannot be accused of being the only, or even the principal, warmonger of the age'). <br/><br/>There are a few cases where Roberts criticises Napoleon more than other historians: his treatment of women and the laws he introduced (sexist even for his time, women as birth machines for the army), or the way he treated Jews ('Napoleon therefore hardly deserves his present reputation in Jewry as a righteous Gentile').<br/><br/>Reading this I learned lots of fun things, Roberts has a knack for finding these small side-actors who deserve their own books:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[Pauline Fourès] later made a fortune in the Brazilian timber business, wore men’s clothing and smoked a pipe, before coming back to Paris with her pet parrots and monkeys and living to be ninety.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What's ridiculous is how fast-paced Napoleon's life is, you can't help but compare your own life. He learned French at 9, joined the army as a secondary lieutenant at 16, brigadier general at 24, commander of a whole army at 27, Emperor of France at 35, lost everything and was exiled at 45, died (as Roberts is adamant, of stomach cancer like his father, not of any poisonous plot) at 51. That to me is the biggest strength here, how Roberts succeeds in depicting Napoleon's sheer energy and speed (often by citing from Napoleon's many micro-managing letters).<br/><br/>Another fun thing I learned is that if there are indeed infinite universes where everything possible has happened, then we live in one of the few universes where Napoleon <i>didn't</i> die on the battlefield. I think there are at least 20 sentences like this, perhaps somebody else should count?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>With the Emperor riding beside him, Desvaux was cut in half by a cannonball.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[..] where a howitzer shell disembowelled a horse [Napoleon] was riding but left him unscathed.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and so on! <br/><br/>Overall, very, very interesting reading, I can see why this is generally recommended as <i>the</i> general Napoleon biography.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Napoleon’s life and career stand as a rebuke to determinist analyses of history which explain events in terms of vast impersonal forces and minimize the part played by individuals. We should find this uplifting, since, as George Home, that midshipman on board HMS Bellerophon, put it in his memoirs, ‘He showed us what one little human creature like ourselves could accomplish in a span so short.’<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>P.S.: Did you know Napoleon was nearly exiled to Botany Bay (the one in Sydney) instead of St. Helena? I didn't!<br/><br/>P.P.S.: <br/><blockquote><br/>Only those openly denouncing Napoleon were liable to arrest, and even this mild crackdown was carried out in a classically French eighteenth-century manner. When the royalist Charles de Rivière ‘proclaimed his hopes a little too spitefully and prematurely’, he was sent to La Force prison, but was later released when a friend won his freedom in a game of billiards against Savary.<br/></blockquote><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This makes for very interesting reading in these Trump times where the <i>weirdest</i> characters pop up in the US, since I realised that these people were there for the longest time.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I recall one particularly heady Outreach meeting, in 1985, at which one of the speakers was a fantast named Jack Wheeler, who liked to say that Izvestia had described him as an “ideological gangster” (“When the Soviet Union calls me that, it means I’m starting to get under their skin”) but was identified on the afternoon’s program simply as “Philosopher, Traveler, and Founder of the Freedom Research Foundation.”<br/>[...]<br/>On such afternoons the enemy was manifold, and often within. The “Red Empire” was of course the enemy. “Christian communists” were also the enemy. “Guilt-ridden masochistic liberals” were the enemy, and “the radical chic crowd that always roots for the other side,” the “Beverly Hills liberals with their virulent hatred of America.”<br/>[...]<br/>This was not a group which would have appeared to need much instruction in administration policy in Central America. This was not a group apt to raise those questions about Central America commonly raised in less special venues. In fact there was for many people in Room 450 just one question about Central America, which was why the United States was compelled to deal through surrogates there when it could be fighting its own war for the minds of mankind, and it was this question that the briefers addressed by tapping into the familiar refrain: the United States was forced to deal through surrogates because of the defeatists, because of the appeasers, because of the cowards and the useful fools and the traitors, because of what Jack Wheeler had called “that virulent hatred for America as a culture and as a nation and as a society” which was understood, by virtually everyone in the room, to infect the Congress, to infect the State Department, and above all to infect the media, which were, as Otto Juan Reich had said not long after he was appointed coordinator of public diplomacy, “being played like a violin by the Sandinistas.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This sounds <i>exactly</i> like the replies to a regular Trump tweet, and this is from 1987! (The man still runs a blog, and all the articles read exactly like you'd expect, no need to link here)<br/><br/>- In a similar vein, concepts similar to 'alternative facts', this gaslighting where the 'opposite' side is perpetrating all these cruelties to get the public on their side, was back then a staple of US politics, Reagan was already good at that.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“There was no blacklist of Hollywood,” Ronald Reagan told Robert Scheer of the Los Angeles Times during the 1980 campaign. “The blacklist in Hollywood, if there was one, was provided by the communists.” “I’m going to voice a suspicion now that I’ve never said aloud before,” Ronald Reagan told thirty-six high-school students in Washington in 1983 about death squads in El Salvador. “I wonder if all of this is right wing, or if those guerrilla forces have not realized that by infiltrating into the city of San Salvador and places like that, they can get away with these violent acts, helping to try and bring down the government, and the right wing will be blamed for it.” “New intelligence shows,” Ronald Reagan told his Saturday radio listeners in March of 1986, by way of explaining why he was asking Congress to provide “the Nicaraguan freedom fighters” with what he called “the means to fight back,” that “Tomás Borge, the communist interior minister, is engaging in a brutal campaign to bring the freedom fighters into discredit. You see, Borge’s communist operatives dress in freedom fighter uniforms, go into the countryside and murder and mutilate ordinary Nicaraguans.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What's going on right now is nothing new.<br/><br/>This is great, dense, political non-fiction, several magazine articles put together into a longer report. not an easy read because reality isn't a nice straight story, names appear and immediately disappear, small places of action appear only to be forgotten by history itself - impossible to keep track of everything...<br/><br/>P.S.: I learned a new word, 'inchoately', being only partially in existence or operation",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's short, so it has to be dense, many philosophers only get a single paragraph quickly stating their main message and their main works. 205 philosophers are described over ~100 pages, so it has to be dense.<br/><br/>The best part about this is how it logically connects the thinking of philosophers I've previously thought to be quite distinct, showing how Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Derrida, and many more modern philosophers can all be connected past (as Rentsch implies) the quarrels or constraints put forward by adherents of 'different' schools. I haven't read anything like that elsewhere.<br/><br/>One thing that's missing is Heidegger's black books (<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/13/martin-heidegger-black-notebooks-reveal-nazi-ideology-antisemitism'>The Guardian on their publication in 2014</a>). Heidegger was in the NSDAP, for a long time some people defended that as a pure career move. His newly released private notebooks show that he was a much bigger antisemite than previously thought. Rentsch doesn't talk about that evidence and (warily) says that Heidegger's lectures can even be interpreted as distancing himself from Nazi thought ('seine Vorlesungen und Studien eindringlichen Untersuchungen zum Deutschen Idealismus, zu Hölderlin und zu Nietzsche, die sich auch als kritische Distanzierung von der NS-Ideologie verstehen lassen.')<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a very dense and at times very dry rollercoaster through modern philosophy, and where it all connects.<br/><br/>P.S.: Interestingly, Slavoj Zizek is missing, wonder why that is, too much pop? Too little influence on academia?<br/><br/>P.P.S.: The best definition of 'postmodern' I've read:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Der Begriff «Postmoderne» macht Karriere und wird in den 1980er Jahren zum Epochentitel. Was besagt er? Lyotard argumentiert für den Abschied von allen bisher die Weltgeschichte dominierenden «großen Ideologien». Er will keine neue Epoche bezeichnen, sondern die geistige Befindlichkeit der Gegenwart nach dem «Ende der großen Erzählungen» erfassen. Diese Erzählungen (Christentum, Kapitalismus, Sozialismus, Marxismus und Kommunismus, technologische Revolution) strebten in Neuzeit und Moderne stets danach, alle kleineren Erzählungen zu vereinnahmen und zu unterdrücken. Demgegenüber gilt es, so Lyotard in Le différend (1983; Der Widerstreit, 1989), die Komplexität und Inkommensurabilität der unterschiedlichen kategorialen Kontexte und Sprachspiele herauszuarbeiten und zu würdigen. Die ursprüngliche Bedeutung von «Postmoderne» ist also kein trauernder Abgesang auf die Moderne, sondern ein dezidiertes Plädoyer für einen Differentialismus, der die Moderne in ihrer Vielschichtigkeit neu durcharbeiten und aneignen soll. Das Konzept des Widerstreits versucht, mit Kant und Wittgenstein einen radikalen Pluralismus heterogener und inkommensurabler Diskursarten zu denken. Es richtet sich so explizit gegen Habermas’ Diskursethik und Konsenstheorie der Wahrheit.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I won't bother translating this, but the gist is that 'postmodern' isn't some kind of sad farewall of modernity, but a novel way to approach all the different ways of discourse (many of which are thought to be incommensurable) and trying to work through all of them while keeping in mind that this way, truth cannot be based on consensus.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

They lived at the same time, looked at the same problems, even met once, but came to different conclusions on how to help people.<br/><br/>Mann takes the lives of both as exemplars for two ways to view the world: Borlaug stands for 'wizards', who believe that for any problem there is a technical solution (notable books are [b:Darwinian Agriculture: How Understanding Evolution Can Improve Agriculture|13748062|Darwinian Agriculture  How Understanding Evolution Can Improve Agriculture|R. Ford Denison|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1349029167s/13748062.jpg|19381554] and most silver- and golden-era science-fiction).<br/><br/>Vogt stands for 'prophets', who believe that such technical solutions are ultimately hubris, humanity should go back and live in harmony with nature, work on a small scale, and scale back industry (some notable books in that corner which I all detested: [b:The One-Straw Revolution|976905|The One-Straw Revolution|Masanobu Fukuoka|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327379081s/976905.jpg|455641], [b:Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit|227265|Ishmael  An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit|Daniel Quinn|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388180479s/227265.jpg|1041162] - you can see I'm biased to which world-view I come from).<br/><br/>After the biographies come four chapters which look at problems mankind currently faces, climate change, loss of drinkable water, air pollution, food, and the solutions both 'sides' have for each problem. Here Mann loses me a bit, since he shows these two worldviews as completely opposed - the wizards want to build big desalination plants, the prophets want to get people to stop wasting water and get water-saving plants. I live in Perth which has huge problems with water, yet people have green European-style lawns which do nothing but waste water in a very dry area. I want the best of the wizard and prophet world: I'd love there to be more desalination plants, I'd love for people to abandon green lawns, why can't I have both?<br/><br/>What impresses me is that Mann manages to show the upsides of both sides, where they go well, where they go wrong, it's easy to fall into one side.<br/><br/>What's impressed me the most is that Mann looks at both men's lives, and finds flaws in both ways to view the world. Both (according to Mann) missed the social view, ignored the social scientists' view points. Both usually ignored the structure of power - Vogt, as a representative of the rich West, was often criticised for trying to tell poor people in developing countries to stop developing. If you're poor and have no support from the state, how else are you supposed to have a stable family but by having lots of kids? Borlaug on the other hand would often ignore or not see the political side of his work, and would get frustrated by people pushing back (corruption, fear of change, greed, and especially power imbalances to which Borlaug was often blind). That is to me, the main takeaway of this book - you cannot ignore the social side of your inventions, you cannot ignore the <i>system</i> within which your work happens.

It's a serialised story to be published in a magazine so he always writes a few pages and sends them off, no chance to change elements in the story. He realises that the name of the person he modelled the story's victim after has accidentally crept into the manuscript, and becomes paranoid that now someone is going to murder the 'model', which would cast a bad light on him.<br/><br/>It sounds like a metafictional detective story and <i>some</i> of it is, but a larger part of the novel is about Mizuno's paranoia, his money problems, his weaseling for money, his prostitute excursions, etc. pp. So if you're looking for a crime novel you're probably in the wrong place, it's much more psychological, much more concerned with what's happening within the writer than with what's happening with that murder.<br/><br/>I was willing to leave it at this and see it more as an experiment in metafictional writing, but the afterword explains and interprets the entire story in the light of Akutagawa and Tanizaki's public discussions (essays) around the role and the goals of the writer  (<a href='https://curiositycomplex.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/today-we-learn-about-tanizaki-and-akutagawa-a-critique-of-delivery-over-plot/'>a blog post about the debate</a>)<br/>Apparently while that debate got slowly heated Akutagawa committed suicide, which Tanizaki took personal. The afterword interprets the story as Tanizaki coming to peace with his (supposed) role in Akutagawa's suicide, not something the average reader (me at least) would know before going into this book.<br/><br/>This is a very recent translation published just a few weeks ago. In the afterword the translator offers bafflement as to why this is such an unknown book, even in Japan. I can understand this cold reception a bit, reading this book is massively improved by knowing about the Akutagawa situation.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Society has collapsed, nobody knows why, the remains of city are controlled by biotech - mermaids, murderous bears, shapeshifting foxes - coming out of the ruins of the Company. King of the city is the wonderfully named Mord, a several floors tall flying, crazy bear-like behemoth, intent on murdering everything. Mord was created by the Company and he sleeps next to their building, which lets the scavengers of the city pick his fur for biotech that gets stuck on his fur.<br/>That's how Rachel finds Borne, a squid-like morphing piece of biotech with the mind of a child.<br/><br/>What's fun here: In most speculative fiction the reader is paired with an outsider so both can learn about the world together. The most famous example is probably John in Brave New World, an outsider who acts as a stand-in for the reader. Both John and the reader learn how the world works together.<br/><br/>In Borne, the reader learns about the world through an essentially non-human alien with the mind of a child, which I haven't seen done before. Borne's intelligence grows exponentially until we the reader 'loses' Borne's perspective somewhere in the middle of the book, after which Rachel's perspective takes over completely.<br/><br/>The other wonderful thing is the relationship between Wick and Rachel, and how it echoes the outside world. Have you ever been in a relationship that somehow 'happens' while you're in a transitive state, neither here nor there? Where you can't talk about fundamental things because it would upset the fragile balance? That's essentially Rachel and Wick's relationship, a relationship with no long term plans and no real 'depth' because in such a world, it's impossible to make long-term commitments. During the story the world changes and their surroundings become stable, after which their relationship follows and is allowed to become deeper.

Here the narrator is baffled that The Island can have evolved seemingly 'without an enemy', in space without a fight, which stems from a popular misconception of evolution.<br/><br/>Evolution is defined as the changing of alleles (let's say, gene versions in the very widest sense) over time. That changing can (and most of the time is!) very random, so you get a different species not because of a struggle to survive, but because of time.

I'm pretty sure I underlined half the book, and what's the point of underlining so much?<br/><br/>Living in 2018 it is hard, if not impossible, to imagine an alternative system to capitalism. This feeling, this sense, is what the term 'capitalist realism' is about. Capitalism engulfs anything and makes it its own ('<i>Witness, for instance, the establishment of settled ‘alternative’ or ‘independent’ cultural zones, which endlessly repeat older gestures of rebellion and contestation as if for the first time. ‘Alternative’ and ‘independent’ don’t designate something outside mainstream culture; rather, they are styles, in fact the dominant styles, within the mainstream.'</i>), so how are you supposed to protest this?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Antagonism is not now located externally, in the face-off between class blocs, but internally, in the psychology of the worker, who, as a worker, is interested in old-style class conflict, but, as someone with a pension fund, is also interested in maximizing the yield from his or her investments. There is no longer an identifiable external enemy. The consequence is, Marazzi argues, that post-Fordist workers are like the Old Testament Jews after they left the ‘house of slavery’: liberated from a bondage to which they have no wish to return but also abandoned, stranded in the desert, confused about the way forward.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Fisher learned from Zizek to use items of current pop culture, especially movies, to make his points., which makes this so readable.<br/><br/>He doesn't stop at a 'simple' critique of capitalism, he delves into mental illness (I'm <i>again</i> reminded of Fromm's [b:The Sane Society|67977|The Sane Society|Erich Fromm|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348386863s/67977.jpg|929738], which Fisher doesn't cite - was he aware of it? Likely!), Fisher suffered from depression so it makes sense that he looks at late capitalism as a causative agent of mental illness (to him, the chemical and structural changes in the brain are (of course) real and can be 'solved' with medication, but does having to live in an insane system cause these changes? Fromm again!)<br/><br/>Fisher looks at the counter-intuitive proliferation of bureaucracy in organisations and how almost magical it seems. Nobody knows what is required, the directives make no sense, so entirely new structures come into being, there is no final authority to appeal to anymore, workers have to become their own auditors and stress increases manifold, while nobody 'outside' cares about the auditing results. <br/><br/>This thought of a visible system, impossible to understand, with nebulous interests, with no overall controllers or rules, that's what makes this book so interesting to read, the 'centerlessness of global capitalism'. Fisher has this neat example where, during the 2008 bank crisis, people complained about the privatising government but not about the bungling companies, he interprets that as a coping mechanism. It's easier to blame a few politicians than an incredibly complex system nobody has oversight over, and nobody understands, and nobody can map. <i>The disavowal [of the government] happens in part because the centerlessness of global capitalism is radically unthinkable.</i><br/><br/>Here comes my favorite quote in this context:<br/><blockquote><br/>The closest that most of us come to a direct experience of the centerlessness of capitalism is an encounter with the call center. As a consumer in late capitalism, you increasingly exist in two, distinct realities: the one in which the services are provided without hitch, and another reality entirely, the crazed Kafkaesque labyrinth of call centers, a world without memory, where cause and effect connect together in mysterious, unfathomable ways, where it is a miracle that anything ever happens, and you lose hope of ever passing back over to the other side, where things seem to function smoothly. What exemplifies the failure of the neoliberal world to live up to its own PR better than the call center? Even so, the universality of bad experiences with call centers does nothing to unsettle the operating assumption that capitalism is inherently efficient, as if the problems with call centers weren’t the systemic consequences of a logic of Capital which means organizations are so fixated on making profits that they can’t actually sell you anything.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>At the end Fisher begins to map out how a 'new left' could react to and work with late capitalism. New ascesis could be needed, since unlimited freedom breeds only misery. The bank crisis has discredited neoliberalism so now there is an ideological hole that can be filled. Bring back the idea of the 'general will' and take back the public space from the state. The 'new left' can start by working with the desires that neoliberalism has generated, such as a reduced bureaucracy, by starting a 'new struggle over work and who controls it'. Mental illnesses should be transformed 'outward', into antagonisms against Capital.<br/><br/>Overall extremely interesting, lots of food for thought, <i>highly</i> recommended if you like to think about our entire system of being.<br/><br/>Sadly Fisher never got to develop these ideas into a full framework,  he took his own life one year ago.<br/><br/><br/>P.S.:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The way value is generated on the stock exchange depends of course less on what a company ‘really does’, and more on perceptions of, and beliefs about, its (future) performance. In capitalism, that is to say, all that is solid melts into PR, and late capitalism is defined at least as much by this ubiquitous tendency towards PR-production as it is by the imposition of market mechanisms.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Now this book is a little bit older, by now Elon Musk's Tesla has <i>perfected</i> this approach: make a ton of PR, sell very little, miss production targets. His popularity alone somehow makes everyone ignore <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/18/tesla-workers-factory-conditions-elon-musk'>horrible working conditions</a> as well as <a href='https://www.businessinsider.com.au/uaw-tesla-complaint-fire-workers-union-2017-10'>firing workers for trying to unionize</a>.

I found this by chance after I stumbled over this:<br/><br/><img src='https://i.imgur.com/pai7igi.png'><br/><br/>Below he says it was either Cormac McCarthy or Thomas Pynchon. After reading this book I'm pretty sure it was Pynchon, this would be something someone who names his characters 'Oedipa Maas' would enjoy.<br/><br/>If you want to read the book for yourself, I'd stop here as now come spoilers!<br/><br/>So the biggest trick the book pulls on you is that it's <i>based</i> on a true story, not actually a true story. It seems to roughly follow Macdonald's career in comedy but goes on wild tangents. The Norm in this book is a drug, alcohol, and gambling addict who doesn't do much comedy but rather focuses on winning millions in Vegas, running away from loan sharks while high on drugs, asking for money from strange rich men who live next to dead salt lakes in deserted cities.<br/><br/>What makes spoiling this book so bad is that the realisation that this is completely 'untrue' only slowly creeps up on you, and that is what makes this book so fun, it looks at your truth and spits on it. You have typical Hollywood photos of Macdonald standing around on set with other actors looking relaxed, and the text surrounding it is all about how his assistant murdered 12 runaway teenagers in ravines. <br/><br/>What makes this book so fun is also the meta-narrative of the ghost writer going slowly mad, full of hate for Macdonald, which probably explains why this is the only 'autobiography' where the main guy is constantly the dumbest, most obtuse, but also most cocky person in the room. There's a wonderful chapter on them discussing how a segment of Saturday Night Live should become more 'punk' and Macdonald constantly shouting how he's not going to sing, he can't sing. The chapter that Macdonald dictates straight to the ghost writer is a rambling story that goes nowhere, full of swear words meaning nothing. The ghost writer dies so the last chapter is written by Macdonald (to pay for gambling debts), where we learn that Macdonald cannot spell at all. Great fun to read.<br/><br/>Macdonald, the true American:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I went from being a low-paid road comic to starring in my own film due to one guy’s help. I’ve never thanked Adam for doing all that for me or told him how lost I’d be without his generosity. And I never will either.

Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>A common theme in Japanese writers around 1900 is 'us' (Japanese) vs. 'them' (Western/European influence). Tanizaki here writes about a specific Japanese aesthetic which was dying out with more and more electric lamps, namely the accentuated use of shadows. Mostly and obviously he finds his shadows in interior architecture, but also in gardens, kitchen utensils, Kabuki, Noh, even toilets (from context I guess he means outhouses). He juxtaposes the Japanese love for shadows and understatement with the Western hunger for improvement and light, all of that in beautiful prose. <br/><br/>Is it true, however, what he describes, and not just a sense of loss for something he personally preferred? Who knows.<br/><br/><br/>P.S.:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Remove the lid from a ceramic bowl, and there lies the soup, every nuance of its substance and color revealed. With lacquerware there is a beauty in that moment between removing the lid and lifting the bowl to the mouth when one gazes at the still, silent liquid in the dark depths of the bowl, its color hardly differing from that of the bowl itself. What lies within the darkness one cannot distinguish, but the palm senses the gentle movements of the liquid, vapor rises from within forming droplets on the rim, and the fragrance carried upon the vapor brings a delicate anticipation. What a world of difference there is between this moment and the moment when soup is served Western style, in a pale, shallow bowl. A moment of mystery, it might almost be called, a moment of trance.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><i>this man soups!</i><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

To me Rampo is a crime fiction nerd's crime fiction writer. He wrote a dictionary (not translated into English?) of crime fiction's common tropes and twists, and his short fiction is full of allusions and outright quotes of the Western greats, like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Dear readers, I wonder if some of you might not be reminded of Poe’s The Murders in the Rue Morgue or Doyle’s The Adventure of the Speckled Band as you read this story. In other words, I wonder if you might not be imagining that the criminal in this case is not a human being, but an orangutan or a venomous Indian serpent or something of that kind. I actually considered that myself.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Rampo uses very common structures and stories and, based on his extensive knowledge of what has been before, comes up with very unique endings and explanations that nobody else has come up with before.<br/><br/>Interestingly (especially in the first story, The Case of the Murder on D Hill) his master detective quotes a bit of psychological scientific literature to explain how you cannot trust eye witness accounts, which to me is surprising, given the release year of these stories (1925!). Only in recent years have the pitfalls of memory been popularised, just think of the <a href='http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html'>Gorilla experiment (1999)</a> which could be repeated in expert observers, when researchers put gorillas in x-rays and 83% of radiologists did not see the gorilla (<a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3964612/'>Drew et al., 2013</a>).  One hundred years between Edogawa's writing and people still find novel examples of inattentional blindness!<br/><br/>Anyway, if you need to choose only one story to read, go for The Dwarf, which Wikipedia even lists as its own novel (it's not that long).

Some years ago, the late Nobel Prize winning Dr. Albert Schweitzer was being interviewed in London and the reporter asked him, ""Doctor, what's wrong with men today?""<br/><br/>The great doctor was silent a moment and then he said, ""Men simply don't think.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[...] er war nicht dumm. Es war gewissermaßen schiere Gedankenlosigkeit – etwas, was mit Dummheit keineswegs identisch ist –, die ihn [Eichmann] dafür prädisponierte, zu einem der größten Verbrecher jener Zeit zu werden.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translation from me:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>He was not dumb. It was in a way pure thoughtlessness - which definitely is not identical with stupidity - that predisposed Eichmann to become one of the biggest criminals of all times.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>In 1960, Israeli agents abducted Adolf Eichmann from Argentina, where he was hiding after being one of the perpetrators of the holocaust. His process in Jerusalem was highly politicised and The New Yorker sent Hannah Arendt to write reports from the process. These reports were merged into this book here, first in English, then translated by Brigitte Ganzow and approved by Arendt.<br/><br/>The curious thing is that it isn't really a report from the process. It's much more concerned with, let's say, the philosophy of law involved in this case. What are the mistakes the judges, the defense, and the state of Israel made in this abduction and subsequent process? Why was this process not focusing on Eichmann's 'crimes against humanity', but on 'crimes against the Jewish people'? Why did the prosecution try to paint Eichmann as the main person behind the holocaust? Was it legal for a court of winners to judge over the 'loser'? <br/><br/>In parts it's a history of the holocaust (at least the part Eichmann's department was involved in), how Jewish organisations were made to help with the holocaust itself, how different countries were involved in the holocaust, etc. And of course in part it's a report of the process itself!<br/><br/>The other thing I've been reminded of is how strangely the 2018 perception of Germany's handling of its own crimes differs from the perception back in the 1960s. Arendt writes extensively about this - Germany had very little interest in prosecuting Nazi war criminals after the Nuremberg processes were over, often because that would have implied people higher up who had made a career in the new BRD. (I'm reminded of [b:Mein Jahr als Mörder|1798068|Mein Jahr als Mörder|Friedrich Christian Delius|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1188494240s/1798068.jpg|1797165] on Hans-Joachim Rehse, a judge who judged more than 200 Germans to death for the most minor things. His post-war acquittal was one of the biggest justice scandals of post-WW2 Germany. To quote the book: judges don't judge judges.) <br/><br/>The abduction of Eichmann was very embarrassing for Germany as it put a spotlight on Germany's lacklustre prosecution of its own war criminals, and Arendt lists many holocaust perpetrators who had made good careers in Germany. Even after Germany decided to prosecute these people they were sentenced to minimal amounts and then often immediately freed again. It's interesting - I have the impression that the modern image of Germany is that of one of the few countries which has done well in handling its own crimes. I'm not so sure any more.<br/><br/>I'm also reminded of [b:Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning|23995415|Black Earth  The Holocaust as History and Warning|Timothy Snyder|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1433433006s/23995415.jpg|43596108], a recent book which focused on the importance of statelessness of holocaust victims. Here Arendt writes about this extensively, Polish Jews had no state to protect them, while Danish Jews had (comparatively!) better chances of survival because Denmark protected them as much as possible (one of the few 'nice' stories of WW2). Arendt also notes the irony of Eichmann's death sentence - he fled to Argentina under false name saying he was stateless, and after his abduction Germany had zero interest in protecting him from Israel. In a way, his own quasi-statelessness made his death sentence politically possible. (Here Arendt touches again on the philosophy of law - Eichmann said he was stateless (under false name!), does that mean he abdicated his German citizenship, or was he still a German citizen?)<br/><br/>Lastly, as the quotes above have it, to me the most interesting part is how Arendt frames Eichmann as a bit of an idiot. He was no architect, no mastermind, he was getting his orders from above and he didn't think for a second. He was educated, but couldn't think himself out of a box. This weird thoughtlessness didn't end with WW2, it's still a common feature of modern life, maybe all humans in general? If I see Peter Dutton (Australia's minister of immigration, very conservative/xenophobic, makes up stories to defend his work without a hint of embarrassment) on TV all I see is empty eyes and thoughtlessness.<br/><br/>P.S.: I'm pretty sure the Schweitzer quote at the top is false, but it fits so well!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Boo me! On the other hand, if I would've added each re-read of 'Spot goes to the library' I would've ended the year at 500 books.<br/><br/>Some highlights (see <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/8325737'>this one for more</a>):<br/><br/>- The new Emily Wilson translation of the Odyssey, I <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2213567193?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1'>compared a few translations here</a>. the popular Fagles translation feels much more like an action movie.<br/><br/>- Blindsight by Peter Watts, a dark SF novel that crams most recent ideas from the philosophy of mind into one story (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/733152574?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1'>review</a>)<br/><br/>- the Edogawa Rampo reader, a not-very-well-known Japanese crime and mystery writer, a lot of fun to read - he's written literally hundreds of stories and books of which the majority apparently has not been translated to English (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1904188448?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1'>review</a>)<br/><br/>- Ice. I haven't read anything like it. (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2230886757?book_show_action=false'>review</a>)<br/><br/>- I've gotten back into Erich Fromm. He's a mix of a sociologist and a psychiatrist who wrote extensively what's going wrong in Western society. He wrote most of his stuff 30-50 years ago but it's still uncanny how absolutely nothing has changed, all of the problems he discusses have gotten worse. (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14142.The_Art_of_Loving'>review of the very important The Art Of Loving</a>, or <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2166572147?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1'>The Sane Society</a>)<br/><br/>- Werner Herzog's autobiographical stuff such as <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2060956071?book_show_action=false&from_review_page=1'>Conquest Of The Useless</a>. I'm always in awe as to  how intense that man's fire is burning.<br/><br/>- Hiroshi Yamamoto's MM9 (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11082143-mm9'>review</a>). This is a book a German couldn't write - for the German publishing work, a book has to transgress boundaries or be 'literature' or be high brow. Yamamoto set out to write a book about giant monsters fighting and he did exactly that, it's just pure fun without fear of being called 'trash'. I admire that.<br/><br/>What's missing:<br/><br/>- I'm still baffled as to why there's no good German non-fiction, the English-speaking world completely dominates that field. Even German non-fiction bestseller lists are usually just cooking books and politicians' autobiographies, no beautifully written sweeping biographies or histories.<br/><br/>- It's also annoying me that there are so many great books on computer science and programming, even the most obscure subfields, but there's nothing like it for other sciences. Why are there so few good advanced books around biology that are not university-level door-stoppers?  Why are there so many 'how to be a good programmer' books (Code Complete, Pragmatic Programmer, Mythical Man Month) but nothing like those books in any other field of work? (always happy to hear recommendations!)<br/><br/>What I'm looking forward to in 2018:<br/><br/>- Francois Chollet's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33986067-deep-learning-with-python?from_search=true'>Deep Learning With Python</a> around the Keras library. I've gone through the first part of the fast.ai course which (in the current version) uses the same library so I'm hoping that my knowledge will advance even more! The ebook/epub came out only ~2 weeks ago.<br/><br/>- Sister Miriam Joseph's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444817.The_Trivium?from_search=true'>The Trivium</a>, a text book leading you through the basics of a liberal education (rhetoric, logic, grammar). I've already started to read it, very heavy on definitions, but when was the last time a text book introduced a concept and then, with a completely straight face, listed angels as an exception to that concept?<br/><br/>- Reclam recently released a collection of Wilhelm von Humboldt (the brother of the more famous Alexander)'s writing on adult education, the role of citizens and universities as <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36671294-schriften-zur-bildung?from_search=true'>Schriften Zur Bildung</a>. The man invented the modern system of universities, and I'm looking forward to compare his ideas with the more profit-oriented 'let's make workers not citizens' system we wound up with.<br/><br/>- Walter Isaacson's biography of da Vinci looks interesting (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34684622-leonardo-da-vinci?ac=1&from_search=true'>see here</a>)<br/><br/>- more C H Beck Wissen books! They published so many of those by now, their store offers 537 books - 100-200 pages of a relatively dry introduction to a specific field, biology, sociology, history, classic literature, mathematics, art, philosophy, everything has a book written about it, and I want to read them all.<br/><br/>Here's to 2018!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Without haste or pause, it was steadily moving nearer, entering and flattening cities, filling craters from which boiling lava had poured. There was no way of stopping the icy giant battalions, marching in relentless order across the world, crushing, obliterating, destroying everything in their path.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The narrator drives to a house to see a woman he used to be obsessed with, and still is. She now lives with another man, but on his arrival, the town has changed completely - it seems to have. What more, it looks like somebody has set off some kind of doomsday device plunging the world into ice.  War breaks out everywhere, the woman disappears, but the narrator has become obsessed with her (with her, and with lemurs for some weird reason). She has become the prisoner/partner of the Warden, a powerful character. The narrator follows her around the world as the ice moves in and society falls apart.<br/><br/>It reminded me of Kafka (especially [b:The Castle|333538|The Castle|Franz Kafka|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1331696371s/333538.jpg|17778410]), but there's so much more going on than there - Kafka's humor is absent and has been replaced by interpersonal relationships and psychology (is there a well-characterised woman in Kafka's work? I don't think so). The whole beginning of the narrator arriving in a decrepit and cold city that has seemingly changed overnight felt like the beginning of Silent Hill, but then we're closer to Sarah Kane's plays like [b:Blasted|146549|Blasted|Sarah Kane|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387302415s/146549.jpg|141431], but even more like [b:Cleansed|146547|Cleansed|Sarah Kane|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387302362s/146547.jpg|141429] - dark, co-dependent, broken, violent relationships in a world that does not make sense. The behaviour of men is close to the behaviour of men in Han Kang's [b:The Vegetarian|25489025|The Vegetarian|Han Kang|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1478196580s/25489025.jpg|18449744].<br/>The dreamlike reality with frequent scene (and time?) jumps and hard to explain behaviour reminded me of Bruno Schulz' [b:The Street of Crocodiles|244261|The Street of Crocodiles|Bruno Schulz|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388849901s/244261.jpg|902938] (another 10/5 book!). It's like  those dreams where you <i>have</i> to pursue a specific course but you cannot explain to yourself why. Whole scenes suddenly change into vision-like dreams, the Girl (or someone who looks like her) often dies only to live again in the next scene. Armies maraud only for towns to be intact again. <br/><br/>If you're looking for a coherent plot or probable events you have to look somewhere else.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow<br/><br/>What makes this book so great is not just the atmosphere, it's the psychology of the narrator. He presents himself to the reader as a good guy who just wants to save her, but over the pages it becomes clear he's an emotionally stunted asshole. He wants her to need him and he sees himself as someone to save her but she wants nothing to do with him, she sees him for what he is, only at the very end does the narrator realise his self-deception only to ignore his realisation ('[Her] words presented a view of myself I much preferred not to see.'). When he sees her happy he becomes angry and annoyed - when he travels thousands of kilometers to find her and she is not exhilarated he bursts into angry shouting, how dare she not accept his oh-so-amazing behaviour, his white knight on a horse crap.<br/><br/>Doris Lessing was right: there's nothing else like it.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
25499740,Geschichte der römischen Literatur,Thomas Baier,"Baier, Thomas",,"=""""","=""9783406562464""",3,3.00,C.H.Beck,Paperback,128,2010,2010,,2017/12/28,"non-fiction, rome","non-fiction (#141), rome (#2)",read,"Like all C H Beck Wissen books, this is a good concise summary, this one is on the history of Roman literature. up until Latin Christian literature started (~about 200). It's split up into genres - Epic, didactic poem, poetry, letters, etc., each genre is (mostly) chronologically sorted shortly describing the life and work of important proponents of each genre, with a short assessment from Baier as to why that particular author was famous or was made fun of. The more influential and famous authors get more space: Cicero, Ennius, Horaz, Ovid, Seneca, Vergil (especially Vergil!), and now my to-read list has ballooned up even more. It's written for a general audience, most concepts are shortly explained, Latin quotes are always translated.<br/><br/>Some things I learned:<br/><br/>- Novels were new and considered trash, so very little is known about Roman novels since nobody reviewed or quoted them, 'not literature'. Interestingly the surviving ones all have a similar structure: they <i>start</i> with a happy end of a couple marrying, and then follow the couple as they're split up and are lost in the world, trying to find each other again.<br/><br/>- It's all Greek. The majority of Roman literature is based on and an extension of Greek literature, starting with Romans seeing themselves as descendants of one of Odysseus' children.<br/><br/>- Romans invented satire, mixing their own satirical songs with Greek-influenced literature.<br/><br/>- Tacitus' book on the Germans sounds like  great fun, to quote Baier: <i>Tacitus zeichnet bei der Schilderung ethnographischer Details das changierende Bild eines freies selbstbewussten Volkes mit einem Einschlag zum Asozialen.</i> To translate: Tacitus describes ethnographic details [of the Germans] as a confident people with a touch of being anti-social. ('asozial' has different implications, I don't think there's a right English word, asozial is not just being anti-social, it also implies lower class).<br/>It's fun (keep in mind that there is little connection between modern and ancient Germans), but I'm reminded of how German McDonald's branches need to have more single tables than usually planned for because Germans are too anti-social.<br/><br/>- Baier has a rather fun image of Romans as people who just weren't used to literature. There's very few famous literature and people didn't know how to react. He has a story on Terenz' Hecyra, which apparently had to be premiered three times: the first two times the actors couldn't finish because the audience was either too loud and rude, or because tightrope walkers and fistfights nearby led the audience to walk out, that was more interesting.<br/><br/>- So much of Roman literature was based on Greek literature, but there seems to have been an unwritten rule that people not take the same Greek source twice, a Roman author renewing a Greek play kind of 'burned' the source for others. Luscius Lavinus hated Terenz because Terenz 'used up' too many Greek plays.<br/><br/>What I'm still missing:<br/><br/>- How did Roman literature work on a logistical level? If it's all handwritten and copied, who filled the book-stores? Surely not monks.<br/><br/>Fun how much information fits into ~100 pages.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Since Beard is a classicist a large part of the book focuses on the role of women in antiquity, but she connects nicely how modern and recent men used (either consciously or sub-consciously) those stories, myths and images to justify why women should be kept silent in the political space.<br/><br/>It's interesting to see her advocating a different kind of cultural structure - to her women who have 'made it' (Thatcher, Merkel, May) have 'made it' in male power structures, often by aping male speech and symbols (suits, voice levels). She rightly points out that people focusing on women politicians and CEOs focus on 'public prestige'/'high end' of the scale, power being treated as something 'elite'. It would be better to think about power structures from the point of making a difference in the world, and that starts on the street, with everybody. <br/><br/>The only downside is that these thoughts deserve to be much more drawn out and developed - again, this book consists of two lectures,  especially the later thoughts on alternative power structures deserve their own 500 pages.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

That seems to be a common thread in current popular culture - modern weird fiction writers like Laird Barron always have some other reality around the corner, conspiracy theorists and 'deep state theorists' see unseen powers at work (how good is Foucault's Pendulum?!?), much of the 'Urban Fantasy' genre, and of course Gaiman's works in comics and novels. I'm thinking Neverwhere and Sandman comics, as well as the novel American Gods specifically.<br/><br/>The Ocean at the End of the Lane is <i>very</i> much structured like Coraline. There's a young child who unwittingly is exposed to the layer underneath our reality's layer, is then exposed to mortal danger, receives some help from supernatural beings, and evil is defeated. This one is considerably darker than Coraline, Coraline doesn't have <spoiler>murder attempts by regular humans</spoiler>, or the <spoiler>Langoliers, no wait that was a different book, the hunger birds tearing apart the flesh of the 'bad guy'</spoiler>, which I guess is why Ocean.... sometimes isn't classified as YA.<br/><br/>Yet many YA tropes are here, the adults not understanding kids, the youth in danger and being the only one who can see the truth, youthful angst, etc., at least there's no intergalactic SF love triangle.  It's easy to see past the tropes because this is masterfully written, dense in atmosphere, and terse where it's needed. There's a bit more on the melancholy of aging than it's 'normal' for writers like Gaiman, that sets this book apart (even though Gaiman only touches on this melancholy, the main story goes somewhere else).<br/><br/>Good reading for an afternoon.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Postman gives as examples the culture of reading in the early US colonies. >95% of people could read and would do nothing but read, with relatively large numbers of books, newspapers and magazines sold, often on very political themes. From there Postman postulates that the slow, book-like style of argument made its way into political discussions, such as events like day long arguments and counter-arguments by politicians in a public arena for general entertainment. (Here you could also argue with Fromm's [b:The Sane Society|67977|The Sane Society|Erich Fromm|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348386863s/67977.jpg|929738]- back then everybody had a chance and a voice in politics, i.e. to say it with Fromm people were not alienated from politics, and since they were not alienated becoming interested in the process comes by itself!). <br/><br/>Form determined the nature of the content - something which people were sometimes aware of, such as the Dunkers, an early US Christian group who would not write down their teachings for fear they would get trapped by the written word, they would stop developing their thought. How cool is that?!<br/><br/>Postman then switches to the telegraph and shows how that changed the culture of news, debate, even how reality was perceived. Instead of long-drawn articles information was separated into tiny bits without context, and information became less actionable. In the old newspaper world you would only get local news you could act on. With the telegraph, people would receive information on what's going on in different areas of the world, information on which they usually could not act, so why bother receiving that information in the first place?<br/><br/>The second part focuses on TV as the new medium and how it has changed the way information is presented and processed in the US of the 80s. To him the world presented by the TV is similarly to the telegraph disjointed, fragmented, fast, and almost senseless. But there's one difference:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But television is different because it encompasses all forms of discourse. No one goes to a movie to find out about government policy or the latest scientific advances. No one buys a record to find out the baseball scores or the weather or the latest murder. No one turns on radio anymore for soap operas or a presidential address (if a television set is at hand). But everyone goes to television for all these things and more, which is why television resonates so powerfully throughout the culture. Television is our culture’s principal mode of knowing about itself.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Postman often stresses the point that different media's inherent biases are not bad per se, but then he rolls back into ranting mode, bit of a mixed message here, as in:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Television’s strongest point is that it brings personalities into our hearts, not abstractions into our heads. That is why CBS’ programs about the universe were called “Walter Cronkite’s Universe.” One would think that the grandeur of the universe needs no assistance from Walter Cronkite. One would think wrong. CBS knows that Walter Cronkite plays better on television than the Milky Way. And Jimmy Swaggart plays better than God. For God exists only in our minds, whereas Swaggart is there, to be seen, admired, adored. Which is why he is the star of the show. And why Billy Graham is a celebrity, and why Oral Roberts has his own university, and why Robert Schuller has a crystal cathedral all to himself. If I am not mistaken, the word for this is blasphemy.<br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>From there he moves on to politics, and I kept on being reminded of Trump and all that preceded him. In the TV world, politicians do not need to present an argument, all they need to present is a feeling with which potential voters can identify themselves, it's pure advertising, image politics.<br/><br/>Large parts of the second part of the book are on the dangers and follies of televangelists of the 80s, not exactly interesting fare for a 2017 reader. Another problem for a 2017 reader is that television is not the prime way for a culture to know itself, the Internet has taken over, and with it the nature of discourse changed again: I'd say it exploded into myriad possible ways. There are those who use only Facebook and stay there, these people have a very different way of knowing about their culture than people who try to traverse as much of the Internet as possible. Others do nothing but passively watch YouTube videos, others build their own communities. You can't write a book like Postman did about TV since the Internet has so many possible biases, and they all are intermixed, but it's all one incoherent mess you have to work hard to make sense of. I'm not sure whether that's 'good' or 'bad'...<br/><br/>Now that I think of it, one of the biases of the Internet is that the user can actively participate. That is a problem in modern politics: I think that you are still as alienated from what your country, you have zero power: but the Internet's participatory nature can give you the <i>illusion</i> of participation. Your government does something bad, you (re-)tweet your outrage, and then you have the feeling as if you have participated, you feel a bit better about yourself now. Of course you have done absolutely nothing, but it <i>feels</i> like you did. The anger that causes political change goes away achieving nothing, like curses written on paper strewn in the wind. That's an interesting inherent bias of this 'new' medium that, I think, we haven't had before in any culture or technology.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He saves his money all year to fly back to Sydney, to civilization (=air conditioning, snooty people, unreachable pretty girls) for the big summer holidays, but on the way back to Sydney he loses all of his money doing what Australians do (<spoiler>gamble</spoiler, <a href='https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/02/daily-chart-4'>see this chart</a>). He is stuck without money and lodging in a small town called Bundanyabba (probably modeled after Broken Hills, not the one from Fallout, the Broken Hills from Fallout is nicer).<br/><br/>This is where it gets interesting - the way Cook managed to fill his character with horror and loathing on reacting to this small town community is amazing. He hates, hates, hates the place and its people, and that seeps into the language. To survive Grant has to accept the kindness of strangers, since they're Australians, the kindness means 'let's start to drink in the morning and just never stop'. They know he's broke, and in the Yabba, nobody who's broke has to pay for beer or food.  Grant desperately tries to escape but how he's supposed to do that? Nobody leaves, and since this is remote Australia, he can't just walk away.<br/><br/>Instead they keep him extremely drunk and take him to midnight kangaroo 'hunting' trips (<i>such</i> visceral language, wow). There's one of the best descriptions of waking up extremely hungover with no clue where you are and how you ended up here, the best description of that sweaty sticky self-loathing you get when you've been drinking non-stop in a hot place for 3 days, and one of the best descriptions of the weird quasi-shame you have in the morning when you can't remember what you did but you're pretty sure you should be ashamed (for the younger ones: you lose that feeling with, um, experience).<br/><br/>What's interesting is how things have changed. To Grant (and I guess, Cook), the Yabba is a despicable hell filled up with mouthbreathing alcoholic idiots. Just look at the game Cook invented for his citizens: they are betting hundreds on coin flips. But now, from a 2017 millennial stuck-in-3-year-work-contracts-hell perspective, the place sounds like paradise:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>‘I came to Bundanyabba seven years ago because it is probably the only place in Australia where I could practise medicine without the fact that I was an alcoholic preventing people coming to me.<br/>‘I discovered in one month flat that I could live and drink as much as I liked without working at anything, provided I remained what the locals term a “character”.’<br/>Grant said ‘Hmm,’ and hoped the monologue had come to an end. It hadn’t.<br/>‘I remained a character. I live in this hut. I obtain all my meals free from my many friends who also provide me with my requirements in beer, which, with some self-control, is the only alcohol I allow myself.’<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Friends, free food, free beer, and a free hut just for being a 'character'?

I know nothing about advertising!<br/><br/>Surprisingly, it's not boring - I guess David Ogilvy is famous in the ad world (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ogilvy_(businessman)'>Wikipedia describes him as the 'father of advertising'</a>), this book collects various speeches, memos and interviews contributed by his colleagues for Ogily's birthday. Since the book is literally a birthday present it's very uncritical, but there are still interesting points:<br/><br/>- I guess Ogilvy is directly responsible for those weird Coca-Cola TV ads. In this world ads are not to sell a specific product, but to create an image of the company in people's heads: 'Today, I have come to believe, with Gardner and Levy, that every advertisement must be considered as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image.' or 'the kind of indestructible image which is the only thing that can make your brand part of the fabric of American life.'<br/><br/>- it's also interesting from a business/management/looking after your people perspective. His agency often quit on clients for various reasons, often to protect their own people, sometimes because he did not want his agency to become associated with a bad product:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>We only had one office and about 18 clients and I dealt directly with all of them. Personal dislike made me resign many accounts. I didn’t like having to deal with the sonofabitch. Why should I? We pass this way only once. [...] I said I’ve come to resign your business. He asked why. I said because your Executive Vice President is a shit. And he’s behaving very badly. He’s treating your people atrociously and he’s treating my people atrociously. Now what he does to your people – that’s your business. But I’m not going to allow this man to go on demoralizing the people of Ogilvy & Mather. It’s something I won’t accept. So goodbye. [...] That’s why I resigned the Rolls-Royce account. They went through a very bad two-year period. I wrote to them one day and said – I put the heading “Lemons” on my letter (I don’t know if I stole that from the Volkswagen advertising) – I said that the last 600 cars you sent to the United States don’t work. And I will no longer be a party to recommending that people buy them. I resign.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Saying 'no' to something that doesn't work or where you don't want to be a part of is one of the things I still have to learn (but I'm happy to see that the term of someone being 'a shit' is not a recent invention)<br/><br/>They were one of the first to have an explicit company culture with rules and standards with the usual stuff people are used to now. What's interesting to me is that those rules always include that his employees should be good citizens and be involved in their respective communities. <br/><br/>That's something I don't see in modern capitalism - big companies like Facebook and Google explicitly keep their employees out of their respective communities by offering free food and activities with the companies. The idea is to have employees hang around as much as possible to interact with other employees and come up with new ideas. The downside is that these employees are completely disconnected from their (non-work) community since they cannot spend time in it, they have ceased being citizens (and don't get me started on the work hours - these people essentially work 10-11 hours a day while being paid for 8, they may get paid well for those 8 hours but it erodes standards people have fought for for more than 100 years)<br/><br/>I also will use these rules in all of my own work: 'We admire kindly people with gentle manners who treat other people as human beings – particularly the people who sell things to us. We abhor quarrelsome people. We abhor people who wage paper warfare. We abhor buck passers, and people who don’t tell the truth. [...] We admire people who practice delegation. The more you delegate, the more responsibility will be loaded upon you.'",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I've been hearing all these arguments my entire life, who knew they started even earlier then that (well technically they started around Marx).<br/><br/>Fromm's central premise is that an entire society can have lost its sanity, and as an example for that kind of insane society he uses 1950s capitalism with a few side-excursions into Soviet-style Communism (I wonder what he would think of neoliberalism - probably the same things, but even more disgust). In capitalism, you are alienated from everything. You are alienated from political decision making: you can vote but that has very little influence on what is happening on the state level. Why should you keep informed then? Why would you vote in the first place?<br/><br/>Similar for labor - he often echos and quotes Marx while expanding greatly on what Marx said by not focusing on capital alone, but also on the world of the worker's psychology and society. The majority of workers is alienated from work since they have no input on what's being done or made, they have no influence on company decisions, they have (Marx!) only access to a tiny portion of the product.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The use of man by man is expressive of the system of values underlying the capitalistic system. Capital, the dead past, employs labor— the living vitality and power of the present. In the capitalistic hierarchy of values, capital stands higher than labor, amassed things higher than the manifestations of life. Capital employs labor, and not labor capital. The person who owns capital commands the person who “only” owns his life, human skill, vitality and creative productivity. “Things” are higher than man. The conflict between capital and labor is much more than the conflict between two classes, more than their fight for a greater share of the social product. It is the conflict between two principles of value: that between the world of things, and their amassment, and the world of life and its productivity.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Alienation has also crept into interpersonal relationships. People are not interested in each other as people, but as commodities. You don't work on yourself to improve yourself, but to increase your employability. (I'm reminded on the main arguments against taking up more asylum seekers - the usual argument in Australia is that they cost tax-money, completely ignoring that these people are humans).<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>His sense of value depends on his success: on whether he can sell himself favorably, whether he can make more of himself than he started out with, whether he is a success. His body, his mind and his soul are his capital, and his task in life is to invest it favorably, to make a profit of himself. Human qualities like friendliness, courtesy, kindness, are transformed into commodities, into assets of the “personality package,” conducive to a higher price on the personality market.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Where to go from here? I've read many of those criticisms before (but then again, the majority I read were from the 80s, not from 30 years before that), how to transform into a sane society? Tony Judt recently wrote a book called [b:Ill Fares the Land|7821831|Ill Fares the Land|Tony Judt|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1269635764s/7821831.jpg|10861819] with many similar criticisms and concludes that a return to full social democracy (think Europe) would fix most things. To Fromm that is not enough - we need to change things in several spheres, in the social sphere, in the sphere of work, in the sphere of democracy, all at once, patching things up in one corner won't help man. It doesn't matter whether a factory is run by The People or by a capitalist if the workers are still alienated from the labor.<br/><br/>What I loved specifically is that Fromm never tries to go 'back' to some imagined state, like so many other critics of capitalisms are proposing (examples: [b:Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit|227265|Ishmael  An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit|Daniel Quinn|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388180479s/227265.jpg|1041162], [b:The One-Straw Revolution|976905|The One-Straw Revolution|Masanobu Fukuoka|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327379081s/976905.jpg|455641], or whatever Pentti Linkola is on about). These imagined returns are to me the ultimate in laziness - if we all just go back to 'that one past state I imagined and was not a part of' (usually a pre-industrial society), then all of the problems will fix themselves. To me that often implies that a lot of people will starve. To him Communism is also not a solution, to him that's just robotism with the same levels of alienation. Since Fromm is all about alienation he wants to involve people in all kinds of spheres - he calls this system Humanistic Communitarian Socialism. <br/><br/>In this system the state is reasonably strong but many local groups of citizens come together for discussions, and their discussions and suggestions are sent to the next level, which in turn sends it up to the next level etc., and the state's actions are based on all of those small committees (this is actually more reasonably now with the Internet, the Pirate Party has experimented with basic democracy like that). The same goes for work, industrialism is retained but decision making is not. Many small discussion groups get together and their discussions and suggestions are collated into the company's strategy. It is the state's task to not only educate the children, but keep a lifelong interest in the education and growth of its citizens. Art needs to be revived and put back into the hands of everyday people. <br/><br/>What's also interesting is that he proposes a 'universal subsistence guarantee', a variant of the currently highly discussed universal basic income (his variant is closer to regular unemployment money as it expires after a few years so people don't just sit around and do nothing). To him (and I highly agree!) such a guarantee is the first step towards human self-development. You cannot work on your self and take risks if your income has you stuck in a specific situation. If the state guarantees a certain income you can risk more - you can switch life directions, you can switch jobs, you can go back to educate yourself.<br/><br/>Anyway, I could write more, but this is highly, highly recommended.<br/><br/>Here are some more quotes:<br/><br/>On modern politics, perhaps (remember again - this is from <i>1955</i>):<br/><blockquote><br/>They use television to build up political personalities as they use it to build up a soap; what matters is the effect, in sales or votes, not the rationality or usefulness of what is presented. This phenomenon found a remarkably frank expression in recent statements about the future of the Republican Party. They are to the effect that since one cannot hope the majority of voters will vote for the Republican Party, one must find a personality who wants to represent the Party—then he will get the votes. In principle this is not different from the endorsement of a cigarette by a famous sportsman or movie actor.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On current discussion practices (think modern liberals), applicable towards the current discussion on whether you should discuss with the new Nazis in the first place: <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What matters is to transform value judgment into matters of opinion, whether it is listening to “The Magic Flute” as against diaper talk, or whether it is being a Republican as against being a Democrat. All that matters is that nothing is too serious, that one exchanges views, and that one is ready to accept any opinion or conviction (if there is such a thing) as being as good as the other. On the market of opinions everybody is supposed to have a commodity of the same value, and it is indecent and not fair to doubt it.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Can you rebel against this society?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Authority in the middle of the twentieth century has changed its character; it is not overt authority, but anonymous, invisible, alienated authority. Nobody makes a demand, neither a person, nor an idea, nor a moral law. Yet we all conform as much or more than people in an intensely authoritarian society would. Indeed, nobody is an authority except “It.” What is It? Profit, economic necessities, the market, common sense, public opinion, what “one” does, thinks, feels. The laws of anonymous authority are as invisible as the laws of the market—and just as unassailable. Who can attack the invisible? Who can rebel against Nobody?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>--------------<br/><blockquote><br/>Free man is by necessity insecure; thinking man by necessity uncertain.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>----------<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The majority of us believe in God, take it for granted that God exists. The rest, who do not believe, take it for granted that God does not exist. Either way, God is taken for granted. Neither belief nor disbelief cause any sleepless nights, nor any serious concern. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And to summarise:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The aim of life is to live it intensely, to be fully born, to be fully awake. To emerge from the ideas of infantile grandiosity into the conviction of one’s real though limited strength; to be able to accept the paradox that every one of us is the most important thing there is in the universe—and at the same time not more important than a fly or a blade of grass. To be able to love life, and yet to accept death without terror; to tolerate uncertainty about the most important questions with which life confronts us—and yet to have faith in our thought and feeling, inasmuch as they are truly ours. To be able to be alone, and at the same time one with a loved person, with every brother on this earth, with all that is alive; to follow the voice of our conscience, the voice that calls us to ourselves, yet not to indulge in self hate when the voice of conscience was not loud enough to be heard and followed. The mentally healthy person is the person who lives by love, reason and faith, who respects life, his own and that of his fellow man.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I highly recommend to read [b:The Art of Loving|14142|The Art of Loving|Erich Fromm|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1438550243s/14142.jpg|1561022] first, even though it came out a year later. In it Fromm develops his concept of love in much more detail, the few mentions of 'love' in The Sane Society could get confusing without knowing about Fromm's wider concept of love.<br/><br/>P.S.: There's a fun thing happening in Fromm's use of English, since he seems to have written this first in English, then translated to German. Fromm often uses English's duplicity for the word 'man', as it can mean 'male human' and 'human in general on a higher scale' in English. In his original German no such duplicity exists, one is Mann, the other is Menschheit. It's interesting that he incorporated this English peculiarity in his writing.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

(We're currently showing the world that the Nazis were just hiding all the time, it's the first time since 1945 we're having actual anti-Semitic politicians sitting in parliament.)<br/><br/>As you may guess by now, we only sent the higher-ups to jail (or as with the occupying forces: to the gallows), all the 'middle management' was needed in the new Bundesrepublik. The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braunbuch'>Braunbuch</a> was a book covering 1800 rich and influential West Germans who had a Nazi past (only West Germans since it was published by the GDR). Marcel Reich-Ranicki's memoirs have a story on how he was invited to Albert Speer's book launch in 1969 and how, as a holocaust survivor, he was tremendously offended that the German establishment could fawn over this man so much - the same Albert Speer who was  Hitler's favorite, the war minister from 1942 to 1945. In 1954, the German state was running just 162 investigations into Nazi war criminals.<br/><br/>One of these cases (and that's the center of this book) was the case of Hans-Joachim Rehse (only R. in the book). He was a judge in the Nazi system who was involved in 231 death sentences, many or perhaps all on very shaky grounds (In 1943, Walther Arndt said to a colleague that he believes that the Third Reich will soon collapse since the war was turning, Rehse sentenced him to death for 'defeatism'). After the war, Rehse got off scot-free, or as it says in this book: judges don't judge other judges. In fact, Rehse was the only judge who even had trouble with the law, all others quietly lived their retirement.<br/><br/>(You can see where Germany's highly political atmosphere of the 60s came from - a youth that came to the realisation that it was the same Nazis in power as usual and nothing at all had changed)<br/><br/>It's an angry book (English title: my year as a murderer), it tells the autobiograpical story of a young man who grew up friends with the son of one of Rehse's victims - <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Groscurth'>Georg Groscurth</a>. The collapse of Rehse's process caused a scandal in the young Bundesrepublik, and Delius got interested in the case. <br/><br/>Essentially the book is split into three parts, the story of the Georg Groscurth's resistance group and his death sentence, and the story of Anneliese Groscurth after the war, and the story of Delius' investigations with the goal of writing a book on Rehse (which in the end turned into this book, about 40 years later) followed by Rehse's murder as a political statement.  The story after the war is even angrier: Anneliese was a pacifist who tried to keep her dead husband's memory alive. The communist GDR tried to use her voice as a war widow, and in the charged atmosphere of the 50s West Germany did not like that at all, to the point that she lost her widow's payment and was fired from her position (see: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berufsverbot>Berufsverbot</a>),  the West German press attacked her for (allegedly, of course) being a Communist.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the whole book.

Sadly (and this is getting more and more common with 'alternative' farming) that different thing often doesn't hold up to closer scrutiny, as it does here.<br/><br/>Fukuoka advocates his idea of natural farming (important his distinction: it's not 'abandonment' farming, it does require work), summarised in 5 points: no cultivation, no chemical fertilizer or prepared compost, no weeding by tillage or herbicides, and no dependence on chemicals. He says that it's better than what other Japanese farmers are doing, he has to do less work and gets the same yield. Now he doesn't say what farmers in his area are getting, but we can do the math!<br/><br/>Here's what he's getting:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Mr. Fukuoka harvests between 18 and 22 bushels (1,100 to 1,300 pounds) of rice per quarter acre. This yield is approximately the same as is produced by either the chemical or the traditional method in his area.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>In normal terms that's 1300 * 4 = 5200 pounds per acre, or better 2.3 tons per acre of yield. <a href='http://ricepedia.org/japan'>This page says Japan always had on average 5-6 tons per hectar since the 60s</a>. We have to convert from acre to hectar, one acre is 0.4 hectar, so we have to multiply by 2.5 (1/0.4=2.5), so he gets a maximum of 2.3*2.5=5.75 t/hectar, that's comparable to what the rest of Japan is getting!<br/><br/>But is it a useful method? The book is nearly 30 years old yet nobody seems to have taken up his methods. I can't tell how it would fare in Australia, where the climate is much more extreme and unpredictable. Some of the things he advises are already common - Europe has been seeding clover for nitrogen replenishment for about 150 years, not sure whether Japan does that.<br/><br/><br/>What's more aggravating is that a lot of this book is plain wrong, examples:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Trees weaken and are attacked by insects to the extent that they deviate from the natural form.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What is this 'natural' form? Why would insects know about this natural form?<br/><br/>Or this one, annoying because Fukuoka had scientific training:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>And the scientists, no matter how much they investigate nature, no matter how far they research, they only come to realize in the end how perfect and mysterious nature really is. To believe that by research and invention humanity can create something better than nature is an illusion.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>No plant breeder is trying to make 'better than nature' - nature does not have as its goal to give more food to humans, nature has no goals. We humans are taking plants and changing them to our ends, as we've done for thousands of years. They are not 'better' plants since there is no system of judgement. We know that each change in the plant has downsides somewhere else: a plant that has introgressed resistance genes to resist a certain fungus will have a lower yield than plants without that gene at times when the fungus is not present, since the plant will always waste resources on the resistance, resources it could use to produce more seeds. It annoys me when the research gets misrepresented like that.<br/><br/><br/>Or this:<br/><blockquote><br/>You hear a lot of talk these days about the benefits of the ""Good Rice Movement"" and the ""Green Revolution."" Because these methods depend on weak, ""improved"" seed varieties, it becomes necessary for the farmer to apply chemicals and insecticides eight or ten times during the growing season.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Where does this number of 'eight or ten times' come from? The whole point of new plant varities is that you have to use less pesticides! Why are new seed varieties 'weak'? He does not say. It's like saying that new cars are bad because they use more gasoline - it's simply the opposite.<br/><br/>Or this:<br/><blockquote><br/>Foods that have departed far from their wild state and those raised chemically or in a completely contrived environment unbalance the body chemistry.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This is a common argument in some areas of the organic world. We now know that there is no 'wild state' of bread wheat or rapeseed, they are plants created by humans by merging the genomes of other plants. As such, they do not have a wild state, yet here we are eating them. The plants we eat and did not create look nothing like their wild relatives - a wild banana is practically inedible as it's mostly seeds:<br/><br/><img src='https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-124abfea9eb8e2594b8fbf9eaded1871-c'><br/><br/>Does eating a modern banana 'unbalance' the body chemistry? What does that even mean, what exactly gets unbalanced? It's a waffle term.<br/><br/>or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is said that Einstein was given the Nobel Prize in physics in deference to the incomprehensibility of his theory of relativity. If his theory had explained clearly the phenomenon of relativity in the world and thus released humanity from the confines of time and space, bringing about a more pleasant and peaceful world, it would have been commendable. His explanation is bewildering, however, and it caused people to think that the world is complex beyond all possible understanding. A citation for ""disturbing the peace of the human spirit"" should have been awarded instead.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Einstein did not get the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity, <a href='https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-facts.html'>he got the Nobel Prize for his work on the photoelectric effect</a>, something rather different (and definitely not as weird as his theories of relativity!).<br/><br/>In this book, one of the main themes is that humans cannot and will not understand reality, so it's better to leave nature alone and let it stay 'natural' (whatever that term means). Should we as humans just leave the plants alone, and hope that it'll all be right? Take a look at this graph:<br/><br/><img src='https://image.ibb.co/eygV6G/journal_pone_0066428_g001.png'><br/><br/><a href='http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066428'>Source</a><br/><br/>This shows the trajectory of current and expected yield in the solid dots and the straight lines after 2010. The dashed line in the gray area shows the yield growth we <i>actually</i> need to feed a growing human population. In other words, we need to roughly double yield growth in most plants, mankind's growth is outpacing the growth of our plants.<br/><br/>That is the scariest graph we have in my field, and it doesn't even account for yield losses due to climate change (more extreme weather changes, more extreme weather events  etc,  (but it also doesn't account for positive changes - less reliance on meat would free up quite a lot of water and grains).<br/><br/>Enough bashing of the book - what saves it is the Zen component, because that's actually interesting.<br/><blockquote><br/>It is nothing you can really talk about, but it might be put something like this: ""Humanity knows nothing at all. There is no intrinsic value in anything, and every action is a futile, meaningless effort."" This may seem preposterous, but if you put it into words, that is the only way to describe it.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>His description of Ego Death is interesting and fits to what's described in other places (The Conspiracy Against The Human Race has a great section on ego death!). But then again, this does not appear all too often, the majority of the book focuses on farming.<br/><br/>I really don't know who this book is for. The farming stuff is too specific to a certain environment and preaches too much to the choir, and for the Zen stuff it's probably better to get a book that focuses only on Zen (like Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind from Shunryu Suzuki).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

We got to talking and turns out, he's a veteran of the Vietnam war! Until then I didn't even know that South Korea was involved there (as were other unexpected countries: Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines). He doesn't really talk about his time there (obviously, it was the same with my Wehrmacht grandfathers), but I thought I might have a look at books from the South Korean perspective in Vietnam, in order to perhaps learn more about him (he's fun - he takes the bus to study English in the city library, his wife dresses him exclusively in H&M clothes, imagine a student-hipster in his mid-70s).<br/><br/>So here's a book about the Vietnam War from a South Korean!<br/><br/>What a complicated book! Is it a novel? It doesn't really have the structure of one, there's no real story arch, no main characters but several interwoven and connected characters, a lot of it is infodump... Is it autobiography? Is it a documentary? I guess all of that. It's almost non-fiction.<br/><br/>Set mostly in and around Da Nang during the Vietnam War and (in the beginning) following a South Korean soldier who has been assigned to an investigative branch, tasked with keeping tabs of dealing of arms and food rations . Since the US army had (and still has) practically unlimited money their base exchanges are full to the brim - the exchanges are staffed by bored young men looking to have a good time, from there it follows that these things are leaky sieves. You first think it's only the South Korean Ahn Yong Kyu who's the main character, but the book soon branches out - other 'branches' of the story concern a young Vietnamese man who joins the Viet Cong and becomes their weapons buyer in the markets, another branch concerns a general's aide-de-camp who uses his power to stuff his pockets with money, yet another (short) branch concerns an AWOL American soldier who's trying to leave the country... all these branches are interconnected.  The 'main characters' pages at the start of the book lists 22 main characters.<br/><br/>It's not a typical war book since most of the book is concerned with the power struggles and the flow of information in the Da Nang markets - but there are a few tremendously dark and depressing 'war interludes', I guess you could call them. They are interview protocols from the US army concerning war atrocities committed by US soldiers on civilians (a young girl raped and murdered, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre'>the My Lai massacre</a>, a young boy tortured to death, all perpetrated by US soldiers), the interviews are preceded by recommendations of what should happen to the perpetrating soldiers (usually: 'demote by one rank'), these parts are short gut punches out of nowhere. Then it goes back to the markets, there is rarely any 'action'. Only towards the last 100 pages or so do things start to happen.<br/><br/>I think Hwang Sok-yong used this book to document his memory from the time in Vietnam, and since the book is very much concerned with documenting what happened in the Vietnamese underground market a whole lot of writing is <i>dry</i> (is it the translation? I don't think so!), example, from a conversation of two Vietcong agents:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“But what we have our hearts set on are the new carbines, M1s and M2s, to be supplied to arm the militias in the new hamlets.” “My brother would never get involved in such risky business. He’s a very cautious man, sir.” “I’m not saying you should talk to your brother about this. Make friends with Lieutenant Kiem on the adjutant’s staff at the provincial government office. I’m certain he’s now scheming to find a way to develop some business of his own. The money that falls into his lap for helping Major Pham is chicken feed. As far as I know, militia matters are under the jurisdiction of the ARVN Second Division, but since their headquarters are up in Hue, the commander who should be in charge has no practical control. A captain dispatched from First Division Headquarters, along with Colonel Cao, superintendent of military police in Da Nang, will be delegated power to conduct the training and take command of the militias. Lieutenant Kiem, I think, will be responsible for liaison between those concerned.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As you can see, very political, and I didn't cherry-pick, large parts of the book are like this. But that's the situation it described - not only did you have several political factions, each faction has their own subfactions (for example, South Vietnamese traders selling arms to the Viet Cong) with their own goals, all of them scrambling for money, and with capturing that Hwank Sok-yong succeeded. It's just not much fun to read, but you learn so much! Except about my South Korean friends' experiences, chances are he wasn't involved in black market dealings.<br/><br/>Recommended for: ????????",,,1,,,0,,,,,

About 10 years later and I stumble over this book in Perth for $5, so off I go to the land of chopped-off limbs and suicide.<br/><br/>Kane wrote only few plays before committing suicide, so 'Complete Plays' is not a big book - just a few plays and one TV script. All plays are dark, that's not what makes them good, it's just that they're painfully honest. Lots on sexuality, loneliness, broken relationships, sexual violence, love, abandonment, jealousy, attachment, communication, the impossibility of truly knowing someone, despair, all of that garnered with a layer of physical violence.<br/><br/>With each play the structure becomes more and more abstract: Blasted and Phaedra's Love are reasonably straightforward stories, Cleansed is already a more confusing pastiche of scenes, Crave does not have proper character names anymore and no instructions to actors (in fact it seems to be several interstitched monologues, maybe?), 4.48 Psychosis feels part poem/part monologue/part mini-dialogue, characters are discarded, again no instructions to the actors.

Greg Wilson founded Software Carpentry and wrote this little helpful book summarising the very recent research, essentially a Train the Trainers workshop in book form. The focus is clearly on programming workshops, but other 'hands-on' teachers should benefit too. There's stuff about how to motivate and how to accidentally demotivate (say 'you'll <i>just</i> have to...' to imply that the asker is stupid), benefits of a Code of Conduct, benefits of live coding, how does memory work and what role does repetition play, imposter syndrome, etc. pp. It's all very much geared at the structure of Software Carpentry workshops but the lessons are applicable to any (programming) class.<br/><br/>If you've been following Wilson on <a href='https://twitter.com/gvwilson>Twitter</a> or on the Carpentries mailing list you'll see that he's very much up-to-date with the scientific literature on the psychology of learning. The cited papers are from the last 10 years up to and including 2016, if you read this there's a good chance you'll be better informed about what's going on in programming students' heads than the majority of CS professors. <br/><br/>The book is available online for free <a href='http://third-bit.com/teaching/'>here</a>, but you can also buy a physical copy <a href='http://www.lulu.com/shop/greg-wilson/how-to-teach-programming-and-other-things/paperback/product-23200026.html'>here</a>.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The book is epic in scale, at times reminding me of Buddenbrooks, but also very uneven, with boring stretches where neither insight nor story abound. Since the town produces so many sailors the story rarely stays in Denmark, it goes to China, to Australia (Hobart hasn't changed I see), to Pacific islands, always to return to Marstal. The village's people together are the narrator with insights where I can't decide whether it's psychologically deep or armchair psychology, like here:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>She entered with the coffee cups. They were English tin-glazed earthenware, a gift from her husband perhaps, or an heirloom. When she bent to light the stove, he didn't offer to help, nor beg her not to bother, nor suggest that they drink the coffee in a room that was already heated. He knew that the small household task was holding her together in this moment, just as other daily routines would help her survive the times to come. Coffee was a ritual, as significant as the funeral she'd never be able to give her son.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Many of the coincidences with people bumping into each other in faraway places reminded me of [b:The Long Ships|438452|The Long Ships|Frans G.

He is <i>not</i> a fan of Clausewitz's ideas, and a large part of the book focuses on counterarguments to Clausewitz's ideas, Keegan draws on many counterexamples where war <i>is not </i> a continuation of politics with other means (ritualistic war - marauding war, the Zulu style where politics became the continuation of continuous warfare, etc., pp.). A large part of the beginning of the book is reserved to show how Clausewitz's ideas are not general and are much more a product of Clausewitz's upbringing and indoctrination from the Prussian military system (where war was, mostly, seen as a continuation of politics, which to Keegan is rather rare in human history).<br/><br/>After that it becomes a proper straightforward history, starting with prehistoric societies, the Greeks, then the Roman empire etc. pp., over the World Wars to today's nuclear threat (nuclear war is also not Clausewitzian war as it is the <i>end</i> of politics). It is all tremendously well-researched and dense - the role of war in the creation of borders and nationstates is discussed (the invention of cannons made forts necessary, which is then where borders settled), there's an entire subchapter on the importance of transport and logistics in wartime, how the structure of armies changed over time, and so on. It's all here.<br/><br/>His writing at times reminded me of German, very, very long sentences with many subordinate clauses:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>With an officer corps of the quality represented by Ligustinus, formed of men whose life was soldiering, who entertained no expectation of rising into the governing class, and whose ambitions were entirely limited to those of success within what could be perceived, for the first time in history, as an esteemed and self-sufficient profession, it is not surprising that Rome’s boundaries came to be extended from the Atlantic to the Caucasus; it succeeded, by whatever means, in transforming the warrior ethos of a small city state into a true military culture, an entirely novel Weltanschauung, one shared by the highest and the lowest levels of Roman society, but rooted in and expressed through the values of a separate and subordinate corporation of specialists.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>See? Not the stuff you read at the beach.<br/><br/><br/>Bonus-quote on 'non-white' Roman soldiers, which caused a bit of a fuss on the more boring parts of the Internet recently:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In a remarkable survey that was made of the careers of ten Roman soldiers who died in the service of the empire during the first two centuries AD, as revealed by their gravestones, we find a cavalryman from Mauritania (modern Morocco) who died on Hadrian’s Wall; the standard-bearer of the II Legio Augusta, born at Lyon, who died in Wales; a centurion of the X Legio Gemina, born at Bologna, who was killed in Germany at the disaster of the Teutoburg forest; a veteran of the same legion born near the headwaters of the Rhine, who died on the Danube at modern Budapest; and a legionary of the II Legio Adiutrix, born in modern Austria, who died at Alexandria.57 Perhaps the most touching of funerary records that show how widely the legions were recruited comes from the gravestones of a wife and her soldier husband found at opposite ends of Hadrian’s Wall: she was a local girl; he had been born in Roman Syria.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This even held under circumstances of national crises when it was universally assumed that the end justified any means. All effective actions require the passport of morality.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>You can read Alinsky's rules on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_for_Radicals#The_Rules'>Wikipedia here</a>, but there is much more than those rules to be found. The extreme pragmatism (including withholding information from your own people to rile them up sufficiently) can be shocking in places, but it does get things done.<br/><br/>There are a few downsides, for example, he describes 'actions' that would've totally worked in long detail, but these actions never happened due to various reasons. I guess he got carried away by his own ideas in these pages. Similar for the very long descriptions of his idea on proxy-votes, where small mom-and-pop shareholders of a company give up their voting rights to Alinsky's organisation (proxies). All these votes combined give the organisation the power to influence how the company behaves. Alinsky writes a lot about how groundbreaking this strategy is, but it seems that since then, the strategy has completely died.<br/><br/>Anyway, there is some stuff of interest here if you are up against an organisation bigger than you.<br/><br/>P.S.: For some weird reason this book is one of many targets of projection for all of this weirdness Americans have in their head - see some other reviews here...<br/><br/>Relevant bonus-quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>People must be “reformed”—so they cannot be deformed into dependency and driven through desperation to dictatorship and the death of freedom. The “silent majority,” now, are hurt, bitter, suspicious, feeling rejected and at bay. This sick condition in many ways is as explosive as the current race crisis. Their fears and frustrations at their helplessness are mounting to a point of a political paranoia which can demonize people to turn to the law of survival in the narrowest sense. These emotions can go either to the far right of totalitarianism or forward to Act II of the American Revolution.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The focus is on the first RAF generation (thus the title) and especially on Baader (and Baader's extremely manipulative personality).<br/><br/>Aust (more famous as having been the editor-in-chief for the SPIEGEL for 14 years) kept on returning to this book in subsequent editions adding new knowledge. The first edition is from 1985, from before it was confirmed that the GDR's Stasi sometimes helped the anti-capitalist RAF. The last edition is from 2008. (Interestingly, Aust had a minor role in the history of the RAF himself - he once helped steal RAF-member Ulrike Meinhof's young children back from the RAF). Even 40 years after Baader, Ensslin, and Raspe killed themselves there is still a lot that is unclear, a lot of knowledge that is locked away in secret government files. For example, in the end of the book Aust speculates on why the RAF's prison's security was so tremendously lax to allow weapons and communication technology into the prison, Aust focuses on the circumstantial evidence that the prison cells were bugged by Germany, which leads to the question as to why the terrorists were not stopped from killing themselves.<br/><br/>There is so much curios stuff happening in this book I never heard about - did you know that there were a few other anti-system terrorist organisations at the time? Like the 'Sozialistischer Patientenkollektiv', an organisation of mental health patients and their doctors that was sure that mental illness is a product of an ill system, so the system should be destroyed with violence. A lot of this book reads more like a novel than a non-fiction book on German politics - plane abductions! Murders! Kidnappings! Car chases! Bank robberies! Palestine terrorist training camps! Self-built cell-to-cell communication devices!<br/><br/>Even if you're not into far-left 70s German terrorism, there's a lot here that is still valid for a post-9/11 terrorists-are-everywhere-hysterical world; Germany went through all the hysteria once already, and like Western countries now, showed how easy it is for a Western liberal state to throw all of its ideals of a 'legal state' out of the window, and how quickly fear (whipped up by state and media together) makes the populace support such a dismantling of basic rights. (There is another interesting detail with this - the German state thought there were about 1200 dangerous RAF members at the time in Germany, similar to what I now hear on Islamistic terrorists. In the case of the RAF the real number turned out to be closer to 20...)<br/><br/>The other interesting thing is to see how often Germany's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_the_Protection_of_the_Constitution'>Verfassungsschutz</a> was present in the early violence of the far left in the 70s, even supplying Molotov cocktails, bomb instructions and plans, i.e., inciting violence. This is now being echoed in the NSU scandal, where it looks like the same office helped a Neonazi terrorist cell in murdering of foreigners, see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Underground'>Wikipedia</a>.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a movie based on this book, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IVKAAsqcrI'>here's a trailer with English subtitles</a>. (I assure you the book is much less grindhouse)<br/><br/>Recommended for: people interested in what their state is doing, and where it's going, and how it legitimizes its own actions<br/><br/>------<br/><br/>Bonus-quote, it's interesting to see how completely different people used to think. This is a quote from when the RAF stole a Mercedes, accidentally scratched some other cars with it, left the Mercedes there, after which someone else slashed all tires of the Mercedes with a knife:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Einige meinten, [beim Zerstechen der Reifen] habe sich wohl um den Racheakt des Besitzers eines der beschädigten Wagen gehandelt. Ulrike Meinhof setzte zu einer umfangreichen politischen Begründung an: »Ich halte das für bedeutsam und für einen berechtigten Akt der Notwehr des Bürgers beziehungsweise der Selbsthilfe, die nicht auf polizeiliche Maßnahmen wartet.« Sie zog Parallelen zu den Selbsthilfeaktionen der amerikanischen Bürgerrechtsbewegung.<br/>Beate Sturm widersprach: »Für mich sind das nichts weiter als faschistische Umtriebe.«<br/>»Nein, das ist ein Akt der zum politischen Bewußtsein erwachenden Volkswagenbesitzer gegenüber dem wohlhabenden Mercedes-Fahrer. Das ist ein Fortschritt in Richtung auf das politisch bewußt werdende und selbst handelnde Proletariat.«<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>My translation:<br/><blockquote><br/>Some thought the puncturing of the tires was an act of revenge of the owners of the damaged cars. Ulrike Meinhof started to create an extensive political interpretation: 'I think this is an important and a justified act of defense by the citizen or perhaps self-help that does not wait for help from the police.' She connected her arguments to the self-help actions of the American civil rights movement.<br/>Beate Sturm countered: 'For me that's nothing but fascist action.'<br/>'No, this is an act of a Volkswagen owner, who's political consciousness has awoken, against the rich Mercedes driver. So this is progress in the direction of a growing politically aware and self-acting proletariat.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'd think different if someone slashed the tires of my fancy new (stolen) car.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

To be sure I had heard right, I said, Kill? Whom? They pointed at Kinski, and the way they spoke left no doubt that they were prepared to do the deed in the next sixty seconds.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>-----------------------<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Profoundly unreconciled to nature, I had an encounter with the big boa constrictor, which poked its head through the chicken wire surrounding its wooden cage and looked me fearlessly in the eye for a long time.

Both of us, since the relatedness was slight, felt sad and turned away from each other.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

What unites these events is that Zweig makes them out to be mammoth tasks by single men performed in a few days or weeks where everything hinged on their person, which as it turns out, isn't always true - Napoleon was lost even without de Grouchy's error, you don't win a war with most of Europe (we Germans tried, a few times).<br/><br/>It's a nice split between historical events, mostly battles such as Waterloo and the fall of Byzantine, and events in the history of art, such as when Händel wrote The Messiah in a three-weeks concentrated fever bender, or when de Lisle wrote the Marsellaise in a single night. What makes this book special is Zweig's <i>fire</i> - even though the subject matter can be dry Zweig is so enthusiastic about his story and the events that you're practically forced to become engrossed.<br/><br/>This is Zweig on the invention of the telegraph, imagine how we would have written about the Internet:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Daß der noch kaum zu Ende gedachte Gedanke, das noch feucht hingeschriebene Wort in derselben Sekunde schon Tausende Meilen weit empfangen, gelesen, verstanden werden kann und daß der unsichtbare Strom, der zwischen den beiden Polen der winzigen Voltaschen Säule schwingt, ausgespannt zu werden vermag über die ganze Erde von ihrem einen bis zum andern Ende [wird nie wieder die Menschen so erstaunen]. Daß der Spielzeugapparat der Physikstube, gestern gerade noch fähig, durch Reibung einer Glasscheibe ein paar Papierstückchen an sich zu ziehen, potenziert werden könnte zum Millionenfachen und Milliardenfachen menschlicher Muskelkraft und Geschwindigkeit, Botschaften bringend, Bahnen bewegend, Straßen und Häuser mit Licht erhellend und wie Ariel unsichtbar die Luft durchschwebend. Erst durch diese Entdeckung hat die Relation von Raum und Zeit die entscheidendste Umstellung seit Erschaffung der Welt erfahren.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation:<br/><blockquote><br/>That the nearly just-finished thought, the still wet written word can be received, read, understood in the same second thousands of miles away, and that the invisible current, which swings between the two poles of the Voltaic pile, can be distributed over the whole plant from one end to the other [will never awake such astonishment again]. That the playmachine of the physical lab, yesterday only capable of pulling little pieces of paper to itself by rubbing a piece of glas, could be exponentiated by the millions and billions compared to human muscle-power and speed, can move messages, move tracks, light up streets and houses and floats like Ariel invisibly through the air. Just through this discovery has the relation of space and time experienced the most crucial change since creation of the world.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>A joy!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You have to start somewhere which is usually small (here called 'putting the weed in the bag', after the movie Belly), it's better to have a foot in the door than having nothing. Lots of good stuff on procrastination and how you should always keep on pursuing your goals, perhaps even dropping your dreams if they turn out to actually be someone else's dreams. Nothing happens overnight, opportunity comes to those willing to put in the work etc. pp.<br/>- Read books - always keep on reading, read books that are outside of what you normally read, read books with unfamiliar perspectives, read anything you can get your hands on, I fully agree!<br/>- There is a lot of talk about God and how he believes that God has a plan specifically for him, I found this quote very interesting: 'I have to believe that. Otherwise, I’d never have transcended the circumstances I was born into.' That must be an exhausting kind of belief, one where you constantly have to fight off doubts.<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/>- lots of life detail more for people who are into Charlamagne, I wasn't particularly interested in all of his exploits, more for his fans<br/>- there's something that annoys me with all this 'you got to be an entrepreneur' stuff, something that's also common in science and medicine - a complete ignorance of one's own mental health. Charlamagne writes about how sleep is the most important thing, but then goes into how you technically have 168 hours per week to pursue your passions, you just have to cut back on a lot of stuff, where he describes how most of the time he gets up at 3:45am to work on the morning radio, then has various meetings and other tapings, and goes to sleep at 23:00. That's 4:45 hours of sleep, bit more than half of what I need, I can't see how that's healthy. Scientists and doctors have a similar thing going where they think that they have to pull the most out of the hours allotted to them per week, which never goes well (why do you think burnout is so common in medicine?). Charlamagne does not mention burnout or mental health which I personally think is dangerous to ignore.<br/><br/>The fun:<br/>- It made me realise a parallel between 'nerd culture' and 'hip hop culture' - the dumb, edgy, misspelled 'name' you give yourself when you're 14 <i>have</i> to stick with you for the rest of your life, how else would people recognise who you are? Changing your name would be like replacing your entire body with a different one. <br/>Signed: your reviewer, drsnuggles.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Svejk's author Jaroslav Hasek was deployed in the first world war, and the idiotic murdering craziness he saw turned into this book. It's the same story for so much other famous satire, the other prime war-example would be Catch-22 (which, honestly, isn't as funny as Svejk). There's Animal Farm based on Orwell's experience in Catalonia, Kesey's One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest based on his experiences working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital, or everything that Karl Kraus wrote. Even <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/24/terry-pratchett-angry-not-jolly-neil-gaiman'>Terry Pratchett was supposedly a very angry man, according to Neil Gaiman</a>.<br/><br/>Here we have Svejk, an older ex-soldier who is drafted to fight again in 1914. He is famous for being an idiot (as he himself often proudly declares), but what makes this book so great is that the reader is left unclear whether Svejk is really a tremendous idiot, or whether he is the perfect fake idiot who has managed to convince people that he's harmless. Every time a superior is angry at Svejk for getting into fights (happens often) or getting into fights (happens practically all the time) or making fun of his superiors (happens literally all the time) Svejk loudly declares his love for the Kaiser and jumps into a ten page long shaggy dog story after which the superior is too confused to remember what he was angry about (some proceed to faint, depending on how much they had to drink the previous day). <br/><br/><spoiler><br/>To me there's only noe time Svejk acts truly idiotic, an act where there's no later resolution (perhaps because the author died not long after he wrote it). That's the time where Svejk puts on the forgotten Russian uniform and is court-martialled for attempted spying or desertion. That's the only time in the book where Svejk doesn't use his supposed idiocy to annoy someone or to his own gain, it's a purely stupid act, I just don't get it.<br/></spoiler><br/><br/>In this story, there are few 'smart' people, in fact Svejk may be the only one - everybody is incompetent or outright sadistic, every superior is mostly interested in alcohol and prostitutes, everybody is brutal, but somehow it ends up being funny. That's what I mean by the anger above, Hasek saw all this and wrote it down.<br/><br/>It's hilarious how there can be 700, 800 pages on a soldier in the First World War without him ever seeing the war itself. The first few hundred pages are all about how Svejk tries to feign disease to get out of the war (it's, supposedly, rheumatism), then the next few hundred pages are about how he's recruited as batman for various higher-ups only for him to get lost completely, followed by a long anabasis and subsequent military prison, and once he gets close to the front-lines the author Hasek had the outrageous nerve to just go and die. <br/><br/>I like to imagine that we are all living in a novel, and perhaps Hasek's death was Svejk doing, somehow, to get away from the front-lines. Perhaps Svejk told Hasek a long, long, long story about a butcher he once knew in Kutná Hora who thought he was a writer, etc. pp., and about 20 pages later Hasek's heart got all confused and simply stopped. Maybe Svejk then simply walked home to tell another story.<br/><br/>I don't get why this book isn't more famous, it's easily one of the funniest books I've ever read.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who don't want others to look at them when they laugh weirdly on the bus at 8am<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Überhaupt«, sagte der Einjährigfreiwillige, während er sich unter die Decke legte, »stinkt alles in der Armee nach Verrottung. Bislang sind die bestürzten Massen noch nicht zur Besinnung gekommen. Mit weit aufgerissenen Augen gehen sie hin und lassen sich zu Nudeln zerhacken, und wenn dann einen die Kugel trifft, flüstert er nur: ›Mutti‹ … Es gibt keine Helden, sondern nur Schlachtvieh und die Metzger in [358] den Generalstäben.

The later parts are a few collected poems of Herzog, an autobiographical fragment of traveling through Germany, and a few essays on Herzog.<br/><br/>The dialogue goes through Herzog's entire life and work up until ~2013, focusing mostly on his movies, especially his philosophy of his work. What impressed me most about this is how much Herzog is on fire for his work, he never compromises anything, with a certain pride to commit crimes in order to make his movies possible (forging documents, stealing cameras, a few break-ins, planned murders (understandable with Kinsi) etc.). I wish I would burn just half as much as that man.<br/><br/>The dialogue is full of great quotes on the theme Herzog vs. The World full of humor and warmth, here two examples:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Parents these days even send their children to the sandpit with a helmet. The whole thing is repulsive. I would never trust in a man who has had multiple helmets by the age of five.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>You would get me watching WrestleMania before you could drag me into a theatre. I'm much more comfortable with the vulgarity of that crowd. There is more honesty in WrestleMania's fakery than in traditional theatre.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or on one of Herzog's common themes, mankind's relationship with the indifferent universe:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The overwhelming quality of the universe is monumental indifference and lack of order. It's a statistical improbability we're even on the plant, this miniscule speck surrounded by a myriad of uninhabitable, hostile and lethal stars that boil in nuclear rage. Look at the solar system from a satellite and see how utterly insignificant Earth looks. The universe couldn't care less about us, and I hope I never have to call upon it for asssistance. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The dialogue is filled to the brim with amazing anecdotes, some of which you may have heard already (the shoe-eating, the many quarrels with Klaus Kinski including that one time the local Natives offered to murder Kinski, all the crimes committed to get the movie done...), highly recommended. If you're not a fan of Herzog's movies or you haven't seen them, I'm pretty sure some parts will drag as you won't really know what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in impressive people, fans of Herzog,<br/><br/>Not recommended for: tax officials",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You can superimpose people's trains of thoughts, paint them, and they'll look somewhat like the map of a city. Herzog's thoughts must look like a Kabbalistic incantation where if you squint really hard, you can learn God's True Name.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>At the end of November 1974, a friend from Paris called and told me that Lotte Eisner was seriously ill and would probably die. I said that this must not be, not at this time, German cinema could not do without her now, we would not permit her death. I took a jacket, a compass and a duffel bag with the necessities. My boots were so solid and new that I had confidence in them. I set off on the most direct route to Paris, in full faith, believing that she would stay alive if I came on foot. Besides, I wanted to be alone with myself.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><i>Who does that?</i> And why do I understand this need so well?<br/><br/>Maybe Herzog lives in a different dimension, where everything is symbolic, but nobody knows how to decipher the symbols: 'Herbert will tell my fortune, from cards as tiny as a thumbnail, in two rows of five, but he doesn’t know how to read them because he can’t find the paper with the interpretations. There is the Devil, with the Hangman in the second row, hanging upside down.'. And everywhere there's Herzog's tremendous willpower, just walking through snowstorms as i that's not complete insanity, breaking into empty houses, sometimes accepting rides from strangers but often getting out early because it doesn't feel right. If I had 1% of this will I could spit at mountains and they'd move out of the way.<br/><br/>It's got a very dreamlike atmosphere, and you can see why Herzog keeps on recommending [b:The Peregrine|1071726|The Peregrine|J.A. Baker|https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320533665s/1071726.jpg|1058416], both books feel connected, two men who want to breathe nature and would rather not talk to people, almost magical dissolving of the self in the woods. Sometimes you don't know whether it's actually a dream, or an idea for a story or a movie, or a vision:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>A Spanish priest was reading mass in bad English. He sang in awful tones into the over-amplified microphone, but behind him was some ivy on the stone wall, and there the sparrows were chattering, chattering so close to the microphone that one couldn’t understand the priest any more.

I can't comment on the truth of that - the example question on specific landmarks and their size in the Netherlands certainly is ridiculous and requires pure rote learning, but online I can only find their mathematics exam <a href='http://www.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/edu/entra/pdf/archive/17math_e.pdf'>which looks 'normal'</a>. <br/><br/>Since the book is a bit old it works better as a time document of Japan shortly after the bubble popped.

The other part is the author's voice discussing with you, with himself, all the problems he keeps on running in - for example, other authors described Heydrich's limousine as being dark green while some sources and the displayed museum's car are black, so what's Binet supposed to do?? He can't just make stuff up, that's insulting! You, the reader, read one chapter progressing the story around Heydrich - the next chapter is Binet telling you how he just found another source which contradicts some details of the previous chapter. What's he to do? <br/><br/>In other cases you read a scene only to then find Binet's comment that he just made that up, and he's thinking of not keeping it in the final book (his critique of Littell's The Kindly Ones being 'simply Houellebecq does Nazism' did indeed not make it into the first French edition, but is here in the English translation), these minor 'rants' make this book so personal, so warm. Which is a dizzying contrast to the other chapters full of towns getting razed while their inhabitants are shot.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Even so, I am comforted by the idea that Flaubert, long before me, writing his masterpiece, felt this same anguish and asked himself these same questions.

It falls apart towards the end where it becomes a partial manifesto and gets a bit more heated, since the focus is lost, essentially a bunch of mini-essays that repeat some points.<br/><br/>Anyway, this isn't a standard recommendation to software engineers for nothing, it definitely makes you look at <i>things</i> in a different way, hopefully your things will become better, too.<br/><br/>P.S.: great point: if something doesn't do what you want it to do it's not your fault, it's the designer's fault. I wish more software engineers would stop sneering at their users, it's just childish (common acronym in IT: PEBCAK, Problem Exists Between Chair And Keyboard)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In the 80s a couple lives in a small old house in a quiet neighborhood, the neighbor's cat often visits them but refuses to fully become 'their' cat. That's most of the story! <br/><br/>In the background there is a quiet upheaval, the death of Hirohito and the start of the Heisei era, the collapse of Japanese economy when their bubble burst, and the replacement of the last remnants of the 'old' Japan.  There is a very Japanese quietness around the book, lots of Zen-like descriptions of their pieces of nature, almost no dialogue:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As July too approached its end, I found my eyes wandering toward the large rock extending out over the pond each time I went into the garden under the intense afternoon sun. But there was no sign of the white-tailed skimmer. Then I would clap my hands together lightly as I used to, and from out of nowhere a shadow would nonchalantly fly over this way, ever so slightly rippling the air. If I made an arc of water with the hose, the skimmer would fly around it as if filled with glee and then come in even closer, just the like the one before it.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>But again, this has depth that is easy to miss, which isn't something I would have expected from a bestseller:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>We passed wordlessly by the house with the Japanese plume grass, then descended the slope until there on the left, where the old mansion used to be, was a huge vacant lot.

H. Beck Wissen books are always extremely concise, and this one is no difference. You get a broad history of philosophy as it was practised in the Christian and Islamic world starting with Boethius (about 500 AD) and ending with Nicolaus Cusanus (about 1500 AD). Each chapter is 100 years focused around the rise and fall of various centers of philosophy. I found a bunch of new guys to check out - I still need to read Boethius, but also Averroes (Ibn Rushd, who believed that the Quran demands believers to think for themselves, and that therefore there is a duty to become a philosopher), or Albertus Magnus, essentially the first scientist ('I don't care for the wonders of God when I'm doing science', to him philosophy and theology were two different things).<br/><br/>It's great that the author doesn't ignore the Arabic/Islamic world (preferring the term Arabic philosophy as most philosophers in the Arabic world were not clerics, in contrast to the Christian/Western world). There's a small part on how the West, for the longest time, believed that Arabic philosophy 'stopped' after Islamic hardliners took over - as the author argues this is only partially true, but a new philosophy developed by Fakr al-Dîn al-Râzî and others which simply was never translated into a language the West could read). For a few hundred years Arabic philosophy was more active than Western/Christian philosophy, in parts because Arabic philosophy saw actors from many walks of life, while Christian philosophy depended on the rather small clerical class.<br/><br/>Another nice thing is, contrary to popular opinion in modern atheist circles, how much 'modern' thought appears here or there in a forgotten philosopher. So many theologians believed that by doing philosophy, thinking and gaining knowledge, man is getting closer to the holy spirit in himself, he's essentially fulfilling his destiny by researching the world. It's the opposite of the often spouted idea that Christianity was always trying to keep mankind in the dark during the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>Nicolaus Cusanus, the last philosopher of this book (useless side fact: I grew up in his birth town and we do rub it into the face of anyone who dares to visit) believed that all religions essentially believed in the same God, it's just that Christianity got it slightly more right than the others. The universe, mankind, and God is essentially one thing. To him people were making a continuous mistake as they were trying to use rational thought to learn about the infinite while assuming that it's finite, which cannot work - everything man sees is just a piece of God. Everything mankind rationalises is just artificial splitting up by the mind - there are no four elements, it's all just different pieces of God's oneness. The universe is infinite and the geocentric model is not needed. That sounds very humanistic and indeed Cusanus was one of the first humanists, which is why it's fitting that the book ends with him. (All of that sounds like he could have been a lonely kook, but he made it very far in the Catholic church - he was cardinal and vicar general, he is buried in Rome, his heart is buried in my hometown).<br/><br/>So why three stars? We Germans don't know how to write entertaining non-fiction, but we do know how to compress the highest amount of knowledge into the least amount of words, and that makes for harsh reading.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

She summarises many 'weapons of math destruction', WMDs, algorithms that encode human biases, are opaque, which give recommendations or orders that no-one questions, while making things worse. For example, this summary:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Poor people are more likely to have bad credit and live in high-crime neighborhoods, surrounded by other poor people. Once the dark universe of WMDs digests that data, it showers them with predatory ads for subprime loans or for-profit schools. It sends more police to arrest them, and when they’re convicted it sentences them to longer terms. This data feeds into other WMDs, which score the same people as high risks or easy targets and proceed to block them from jobs, while jacking up their rates for mortgages, car loans, and every kind of insurance imaginable. This drives their credit rating down further, creating nothing less than a death spiral of modeling. Being poor in a world of WMDs is getting more and more dangerous and expensive.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>O'Neil goes through many, many of examples like this where an automated approach made things worse, where people didn't bother to critically look at the output, where the model doesn't have a way to incorporate feedback, it's stuck in time and cannot evolve like humans. The majority of the book is spent on case studies and great, angry discussion of what went wrong. There's one short chapter on what could be done - mostly she proposes more regulation (auditing of algorithms), but also to 'dumb' down models by law, force them to treat people equally and not bin them in groups. That chapter on solutions is extremely short - I expect a second book from her on that topic.<br/><br/>P.S.: I've been reading a lot about adversarial perturbations in deep learning (see <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.08401v1.pdf'>this great paper</a>). One idea could be to counteract some of those models to become an adversarial entity. For example, you have one of those shopping points cards. Instead of feeding their model with your shopping data, you mix it up - write down your shopping list for a month, shuffle it, and buy one part with your points card and the other in cash. Keep mixing it up and add random stuff. Your data should be garbage to the model as it's not consistent, easily removable as an outlier, i.e., worthless.<br/><br/>You could also make the model work for you - find out which groups of customers the market sends special offers to, game your shopping so that you fall into that group, reap rewards.<br/><br/>Of course you'd need to know in detail what the model is looking for, which is highly unlikely.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Both groups aren't black & white: the Alliance is led by war mongers looking to secure votes in order to advance their political careers by military gains, the Empire started out as eugenics-supporting space Nazis but has settled down as a more benevolent kingdom, led by an aged and stagnant elite. <spoiler>There's a third and fourth group which is set up towards the end of this book.</spoiler><br/><br/>The two main characters are young military leaders who clash twice in this book, but they're set up to be constant rivals in the remaining nine books. There's Reinhard von Lohengramm for the Empire, Yang Wen-Li for the Alliance. These names work like uniforms: the Empire is full of fun Wagner space Nazi names like Oskar von Reuenthal, even their ships are named <i>Walküren</i>, the Alliance has a hodge-podge of Chinese, Japanese, German, English, Greek names with their ships mostly named after Greek mythology. This ""trick"" makes it possible to follow possibly confusing space-battles easily, you immediately know who is on what side.<br/><br/>Von Lohengramm is an arrogant military genius who wants to take over the whole Empire, Wen-Li is a military history nerd who constantly wants to go home but is kept on by people who need his skills.

You can see this streak in historical novels (personal favorite: Eiji Yoshikawa's [b:Taiko|336228|Taiko  An Epic Novel of War and Glory in Feudal Japan|Eiji Yoshikawa|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1348457306s/336228.jpg|1337700]), but it continues in Japanese media to this day (a recent example is Death Note). <br/> <br/>Will I  read the other 9 books? The second book is slated to be released in July 2016, the third in November, with the rest to come based on how much money the first three make. I'd love for that to work out, it's certainly a bold move to go and commission a translation of 3 out of 10 books with a total of more than 3000 pages for fans of an obscure TV show, but in the age of ebooks it's possible to secure a niche in the ""long tail"" of available media. The ebook is just $11 on the Australian Amazon - that's the price of one beer in Perth.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people looking for Game of Thrones in space, I don't think it's going to be that, there's not enough blood, sex & diarrhea for that to happen.

Some points are developed in more in-depth in [book:Ill Fares the Land|7821831], lots of fun criticism of the current left:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But back home, America’s liberal intellectuals are fast becoming a service class, their opinions determined by their allegiance and calibrated to justify a political end. In itself this is hardly a new departure, of course: We are all familiar with intellectuals who speak only on behalf of their country, class, religion, “race,” “gender,” or “sexual orientation,” and who shape their opinions according to what they take to be the interest of their affinity of birth or predilection. But the distinctive feature of the liberal intellectual in past times was precisely the striving for universality; not the unworldly or disingenuous denial of sectional identification but the sustained effort to transcend that identification in search of truth or the general interest.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The fact that most of these essays are around 15-20 years old lets you judge some of his predictions, and it's not always perfectly clear sighted, there's a sidenote somewhere that a 'moral appeal of some refurbished version of Marxism is likely to grow' - I haven't really seen that in the 15 years since this specific essay came out. Most of it painfully smart:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What we have failed to grasp is that, on the eve of the twenty-first century, the state itself is now an intermediary institution too. When the economy, and the forces and patterns of behavior that accompany it, are truly international, the only institution that can effectively interpose itself between those forces and the unprotected individual is the national state. Such states are all that can stand between their citizens and the unrestricted, unrepresentative, unlegitimated capacities of markets, insensitive and unresponsive supranational administrations, and unregulated processes over which individuals and communities have no control. The state is the largest unit in which, by habit and convention, men and women can feel they have a stake and which is, or can be made to appear, responsive to their interests and desires.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm thankful that these essays focus on books relatively forgotten now, making my to-read list swell up even more (1423 books! 17 <i>years</i> of reading) - [book:Five Germanys I Have Known|869436], [book:Realms of Memory: The Construction of the French Past|2243728], [book:Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East|225897], [book:Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli-Arab Tragedy|311689], and more now demand to be read, thank you.<br/><br/>If you read one essay of these, make it <a href='https://www.jstor.org/stable/20048202?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents'>'The Social Question Redivivus'</a> (try a certain relatively new site by a certain Kazhak graduate student for access if you don't have it). This essay came out in 1997 and it's message has only become more urgent, with a recent rise of the far right which addresses <i>exactly</i> the problems Judt warned us about:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Why are we so sure that the far political Right is behind us for good—or indeed the far Left? The postwar social reforms in Europe were instituted in large measure as a barrier to the return of the sort of desperation and disaffection from which such extreme choices were thought to have arisen. The partial unraveling of those social reforms, for whatever reason, is not risk-free. As the great reformers of the nineteenth century well knew, the Social Question, if left unaddressed, does not just wither away. It goes instead in search of more radical answers.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As an example, you want to know the probability that a coin flip is 'heads': you could flip the coin four times, it always comes up heads, so you conclude that the coin always comes up heads, which is nonsense of course. Only if you keep on flipping do you learn that the 'heads' probability is roughly 50%. However, sometimes you flip a coin four times and two flips come up with heads, two with tails, so in that case you'd conclude that the probability is 50% and you'd be right, but you cannot know for sure, your study is underpowered. In other words - you could trust Kahneman's cited studies, but they could also fail to replicate with more subjects.<br/><br/>There's even a comment by Kahneman himself in the comments section, quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What the blog gets absolutely right is that I placed too much faith in underpowered studies.  [...] I am still attached to every study that I cited, and have not unbelieved them, to use Daniel Gilbert’s phrase. I would be happy to see each of them replicated in a large sample. The lesson I have learned, however, is that authors who review a field should be wary of using memorable results of underpowered studies as evidence for their claims.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Edit 5th July 2016:<br/>This interesting <a href=""https://jasoncollins.org/2016/06/29/re-reading-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow/"">recent blog post</a> looks at many of the papers Kahneman cites, recommended reading:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What a difference four years makes. I will still describe Thinking, Fast and Slow as an excellent book – possibly the best behavioural science book available. But during that time a combination of my learning path and additional research in the behavioural sciences has led me to see Thinking, Fast and Slow as a book with many flaws.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It seems that many studies Kahneman cites failed to replicate.<br/><br/>Old review 2014:<br/><br/>In a way, this summarizes the lifework of Kahneman himself.<br/><br/>The book summarizes the myriad ways our own minds can deceive us - Kahneman uses the model of System 1 and System 2, System 1 are our fast, intuitive reactions, System 2 is the slow, careful reaction for which we have to make a conscious effort to activate.  We're often deceived by the simplicity with which System 1 generates an answer, and this book is full of examples on problems arising from our ""lazy"" brains. For example, if we think about a person's qualities System 1 will fill in unknown based on how much we like the person (the Halo effect). Or, during a sale a person makes a unrealistically high starting offer - and even though we dismiss it, our brains base all other thoughts on that ""anchor"" (so it's called the anchoring effect). The book is full of effects like that - effects which might undermine your sense of reality. <br/><br/>Only 40-50% of the book is about the two systems - the rest is about the problems economy has with psychology, in which the author makes fun of economy's unrealistic assumptions that humans are completely rational; and the rest is also about the experiencing and the remembering self - we judge events not really on what we experience, but on what we remember, and there are myriad ways to trick or influence these memories. For example, we can ""taint"" an experience by adding an unpleasant memory to the end of the experience - people automatically judge the full experience worse than before, regardless of everything that precedes the unpleasant memory!<br/><br/>The only problems I had: Kahneman loves to list examples to strengthen his points, so some corners of the book are <i>slow</i>! Also, his relatively dry writing style may be off-putting to some.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in clear thinking. Decision-makers. Scientists.

Barnaby Rudge features a talking raven, which may have or probably has inspired Poe's famous poem.<br/><br/>Anyway! If you're looking to get into a crime writer with an unique perspective, this Reader should  be a good introduction. Sad that there is no comprehensive English translation: the Japanese Edogawa Rampo series is 30 books, but only 3 have been translated.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The main character is the best detective, but he cannot handle strict hierarchies and always gets into fights with his superiors (I was waiting for him to slam his badge & gun on his supervisor's table, but he does investigate on his own); he was a tunnel rat in Vietnam, so now every case has to include a hunt for criminals in a complicated tunnel-system, women drop in and out of his life since he's emotionally scarred, people die senselessly and brutally (rather constructed: the main character's name is Harry Bosch which is actually short for Hieronymous Bosch, and Bosch's paintings are supposed to be the blueprint for this particular seedy world), and so on, you know the deal.<br/><br/>Still, they're entertaining, they're well written with good pacing, and the stories rely more on brain power than brawn, but with sometimes too many coincidences that make the story progress. The third one (The Concrete Blonde) has a rather messy and confused ending (<spoiler>let's just cycle through all subjects until one confesses</spoiler>), but well, if you're after modern hard boiled and don't like too many surprises, these books are for you.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I wouldn't call Storm of Steel an anti-war book.<br/><br/>Afrikanische Spiele/African Games is autobiographical again, but more self-reflective, more about the inner transformations during growing up than external experiences. You'd have to be a bit German to understand his motives - for my father's generation and his father's generation, the ultimate escape fantasy was to join the French Foreign Legion. I think that fantasy has since been supplanted by dreaming of the zombie apocalypse.<br/><br/>Both fantasies allow for a fresh start and a blank slate (the French Legion took anyone above the age of 18, even those wanted by police, and allowed applicants to choose any name, along with some other wonderfully romantic ideas [1]) together with the dream of being the violent action hero. In our attic are quite a few novellas for boys from my father, and it looks like Juenger grew up with similar ones. <br/><br/>He ran away from his parents' home at a young age to enlist with the Foreign Legion, and that is what this book is about. He starts as a typical young dreamer with romantic dreams of Africa as a continent of danger and adventures, but quickly learns that it's just another place - the pile of rocks he has to move as his first task is not a dangerous magical pile where snakes live, it's just a pile of rocks, same as at home. Observing his fellow 'recruits' and watching him grow up is the main part of the book, there's no wild adventure (except for a few drunken fights), it's all about realising that your childhood dreams have to die at some point. The 'game' ends rather boringly <spoiler>his upper middle-class father pulled some strings and spent some money to prove that his son wasn't actually 18 and had lied on his paperwork</spoiler>, but that fits the whole theme perfectly.<br/><br/>The constant self-observation/reflection gives the book a very different tone than Storm of Steel, which is no wonder since there's 16 years in between - Storm of Steel was published in 1920, right after WW1, and African Games took until 1936 to be published. You can even interpret it as a kind of warning (and the afterword explicitly does so) about what was going on in Germany in 36, the childish idea of the 'single violent hero' was getting a bit too popular.<br/><br/>[1] If a foreign citizen who is part of the Foreign Legion is injured in the line of duty he or she immediately becomes a French citizen by right of 'Français par le sang versé', French by spilled blood",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There's not much mathematics involved, if I remember correctly there's maybe two formulas in the whole book. However, parameters play a large role - if there's a new method presented there's usually a bit of discussion which parameters have the biggest impact on the outcome. There's also quite a bit of wisdom on the many dangers of overfitting and choosing the wrong test and training set (or in the case of cross-validation, the danger of training too much towards the test set).<br/><br/>If you're looking for Artificial Neural Networks then this may be a good start, the chapter on ANNs has a very intuitive explanation of the logic behind layers and neurons, but the focus of the book is elsewhere, which the authors explicitly state (in the last chapter the authors recommend Goodfellow et al.'s <a href='http://www.deeplearningbook.org/'>Deep Learning</a> for that - $70 and no epub/mobi, ouch).<br/><br/>One minor thing I'm not sure about: to skip wasting paper on fiddling with matplotlib the authors often call their own <a href='https://github.com/amueller/mglearn'>mglearn</a> library for plots and some utility functions, I'm not sure whether that 'hides' too much complexity from the reader - but again, from what I'm seeing it's mostly matplotlib fiddling that's hidden in those functions, which is enormously frustrating and has no place in this book.<br/><br/>Recommended for: semi-advanced Python programmers who'd like to learn new ways to make new connections from their data<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who want to know what all that artificial neural network hype is about. <br/><br/>Maybe: People who've already devoured the amazing <a href='http://scikit-learn.org/stable/'>scikit-learn documentation</a>, some of the examples in the book are straight from the documentation (clustering), the more complex examples are 'novel'",,,1,,,0,,,,,

These are essays collected from NYRB about the lives of a few religious thinkers (Rosenzweig, Voegelin, Strauss) and a bit on modern developments (with a agreeable interpretation on Houellebecq's Submission), all connected by reactionary thought. But if you expect to get only politics, then you'll be disappointed, this is heavy on theology:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Th early chuch Father  Tertullian called Saint Paul 'the apostle of heretics' for good reason. Ever since Marcion, the second-century theologian who appealed to Paul's authority for is doctrine that the Christian God was a deity wholly distinct and superior to the Hebrews' Yahweh, the Pauline corpus has been creatively misread.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Nevertheless, when it <i>isn't</i> about the church and things I don't have a clue about it starts to develop a theory of neoreactionaries, stuff like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[The reactionary's] story begins with a happy, well-ordered state where people who know their place live in harmony and submit to tradition and their God. Then alien ideas promoted by intellectuals [.] challenge this harmony and the wil to maintain order weakens at the top. (The betrayal of elites is the linchpin of every reactionary story.) A false consciousness soon descends on the society as a whole as it willingly, even joyfully, heads for destruction. Only those who have preserved memories of the old ways see what is happening. Whether the society reverses direction or rushes to its doom depends entirely on their resistance. Today political Islamists, European nationalists, and the American Right tell their ideological children essentially the same tale.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And that's interesting!<br/><br/>The relatively dense theology isn't the problem with this book for me, the problem is that it's just too short to develop its thoughts, it's newspaper essays, not <i>the</i> book on modern neoreactionaries (and I'm unsure how much of a role religion even plays in modern reactionary thought, it looks more like a tool used by nihilistic reactionaries to appeal to the religious, not an actual source of thought).<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There is a book to be done on Western mytho-histories in relation to the times in which they were written, and the social-psychological work they accomplished in different epochs. Such a book would trace how, beginning in the early nineteenth century, archaic theological narratives about the past were modernized and substituted for argument in intellectual proxy wars over the present.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Yes, please!

The Alien Enemies Act of July 6 granted the president the power to label as enemy aliens any residents who were citizens of a country at war with America, prompting an out-flow of French émigrés. Then came the capstone of these horrendous measures: the Sedition Act of July 14, which rendered it a crime to speak or publish “any false, scandalous, or malicious” writings against the U.S. government or Congress “with intent to defame…or to bring them…into contempt or disrepute.” [...] One Republican editor made the mistake of calling Hamilton’s projected army a “standing army” and paid a steep price: a two-hundred-dollar fine plus two months in prison, where he could ponder his linguistic error. Another editor earned eighteen months behind bars for daring to print the heresy that the government allowed the wealthy to benefit at the expense of commoners. Congressman Matthew Lyon of Vermont got four months in jail for criticizing the president’s “unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or about Irish immigrants: 'Congressman Harrison Gray Otis of Boston set a strident tone when he declared that America should no longer “wish to invite hordes of wild Irishmen, nor the turbulent and disorderly parts of the world, to come here with a view to disturb our tranquillity after having succeeded in the overthrow of their own governments.”<br/><br/><br/><br/>- I didn't know that the major political forces of the times used to write absolutely hateful, lying essays under pseudonyms to try and discredit each other, constantly repeating old disproved lies until the public believed them. To put it in modern terms: anonymous shitposting has always been a thing in the US.<br/><br/><blockquote> <br/>Signed articles were relatively rare. Perhaps the era’s most prolific essayist, Hamilton seldom published under his own name and drew on a bewildering array of pseudonyms. Such pen names were sometimes transparent masks through which the public readily identified prominent politicians. The fashion of allowing anonymous attacks permitted extraordinary bile to seep into political discourse, and savage remarks that might not otherwise have surfaced appeared regularly in the press. The brutal tone of these papers made politics a wounding ordeal. [...] Other articles followed with equally heavy-handed hints that Hamilton and his retinue planned to enslave America under a monarchy and an aristocracy. [...] [Hamilton] had learned a lesson about propaganda in politics and mused wearily that “no character, however upright, is a match for constantly reiterated attacks, however false.” If a charge was made often enough, people assumed in the end “that a person so often accused cannot be entirely innocent.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>People kept on insinuating that Hamilton had collaborated with the British during the revolution for profit, a lie based on nothing that stuck. Keep on repeating the lie and your followers will believe and repeat it - see everything about the US election campaign, which raised that 'trick' to a new high. (The fact that anonymous essays helped steer politics also explains where the weirdly naive story-arc of  Locke/Demosthenes essays in Ender's Game comes from)<br/><br/>- Emotions always trump facts and logic, to quote Hamilton: 'Men are rather reasoning than reasonable animals, for the most part governed by their passion'<br/><br/>Above I wrote that it's sometimes too gushing about Hamilton, Chernow clearly loves him, which leads to the writing sometimes being too biased and you wonder whether you're reading a clear account of what actually happened. Chernow likes to portray Hamilton's political enemies in the worst way possible:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The author of this malice was the Scottish-born James Thomson Callender, an ugly, misshapen little man who made a career of spewing venom. He was a hack writer who had fled from Edinburgh a few years earlier after being charged with sedition by the British government.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Without those tiny pieces I would've probably rated the book higher. Luckily the gushing stops at around the time of Washington's death, after which Hamilton's actions became dumber and dumber. Anyway, there are probably more even-handed biographies of Hamilton, this one set out to revise some common beliefs of Hamilton and succeeds, but I don't need convincing since I never learned about the common beliefs in the first place. If you want motivation, you can't go wrong, Hamilton's life can show you what you can achieve with intelligence and extremely hard work.<br/><br/><br/>Bonus-quote: John Adams on the late Benjamin Franklin: 'His whole life has been one continued insult to good manners and to decency', what a wonderful epitaph!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Modern life is too much about rejecting difficulty, about rejecting responsibility. Do the hard thing. Love isn't something you fall into, love is something that you have to work hard for (and just like the author I love Erich Fromm): absolutely no-one is easy to live with, there is no 'right' person. Modern office work culture is ridiculous. Traveling for entertainment is largely useless, and so on.<br/><br/>It's all presented in a learned, polemic style, example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Secluded from the left by the righteousness of entitlement and from the right by the glamour of potential, it is easy to believe that fulfillment is not only a basic right but thoroughly deserved, and that attaining it requires no more thought, effort or patience than an escalator ride to the next level of the shopping centre.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Septuagenarians have intense memories of youth, remember hardly anything about the middle period, and have intense memories again about the recent past. All the surveys seem to agree that the middle years are a crock of shit.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Two problems: 1) Sometimes the strawmanning/boogeymanning takes over and it gets ridiculous, he derides how computer games are mere escapist fantasies, and cites (among others) Broken Sword as a 'sword fantasy'. That game had nothing to do with swords! (oh and also, World of Warcraft is a 'website' now). (FWIW: I largely agree with his point on computer games, I have a Steam library worth a small car but I just cannot be bothered anymore) 2) Very, very often the author cites psychological research to support his points. With the way psychological research <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis'>is currently developing</a> I wonder how many of those studies failed to replicate.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're after some good old-fashioned 'it's all terrible, especially <i>you</i>', then go for it!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In fact, it's mostly about politics and what a mess law enforcement was/is (it's set in 1988/1989, unsure how much has changed). <br/><br/>The main 'story' are a few hard cases which take the majority of the year to work, add to that shorter stories of various cases worked by the homicide squad, and again interwoven with mini-essays, for example, on police-involved shootings and the unreasonable expectations society has:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>A heavily armed nation prone to violence finds it only reasonable to give law officers weapons and the authority to use them. In the United States, only a cop has the right to kill as an act of personal deliberation and action. To that end, Scotty McCown and three thousand other men and women were sent out on the streets of Baltimore with . 38-caliber Smith & Wessons, for which they received several weeks of academy firearms training augmented by one trip to the police firing range every year. Coupled with an individual officer’s judgment, that is deemed expertise enough to make the right decision every time. It is a lie. It is a lie the police department tolerates because to do otherwise would shatter the myth of infallibility on which rests its authority for lethal force. And it is a lie that the public demands, because to do otherwise would expose a terrifying ambiguity. The false certainty, the myth of perfection, on which our culture feeds requires that Scotty McCown should have shouted a warning before firing three shots, that he should have identified himself as a police officer and told Ja-Wan McGee to drop what he believed was a weapon.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or on how to survive being around death:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>For the detectives, the rule of thumb is that if you think about it, if you allow the imagery to be about human beings rather than evidence, you will be led to some strange and depressing places. Insisting on this distance is an acquired skill, and for new detectives, an established rite of passage. New men are measured by their willingness to watch a body disassembled and then adjourn to the Penn Restaurant, on the other side of Pratt Street, for the three-egg special and a beer.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Add to that the numerous stories of male station banter (it's an almost 100% male world - reminds me quite a lot of Moehringer's <i>Tender Bar</i>) and various tiny hilarious stories, like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[Donald] Worden knew the man they were chasing, of course, just as the man knew Worden. For these were the halcyon days of the Big Man’s twelve-year tour in the Northwest, when a rough cordiality still existed among the players and Worden was on a first-name basis with anyone in the district who was worth arresting. When the gunfire ended the foot chase and they caught up to their suspect, the man was shocked. <br/>“Donald,” he said, “I can’t believe it.” <br/>“What?” <br/>“You tried to kill me.” <br/>“No, I didn’t.” <br/>“You shot at me.” <br/>“I fired over your head,” Worden said, chastened. “But look, I’m sorry about it, okay?”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>To me the mini-essays are the most interesting part because Simon really understands humans; you get such an in-depth portray of some of the detectives, I really wonder how Simon managed to come up with those in just a single year.<br/><br/>In a way, homicide work reminded me a lot of scientific work - some cases are 'dunkers', where the detective shows up at the crime scene and immediately has a suspect, witnesses, ample evidence, etc. Then there are the 'whodunits', cases with absolutely nothing of the above, where sheer luck leads to a solve, or detectives get so stuck that it may end their careers if they don't shelve the case. In science it's similar - sometimes you start a project and the results just jump at you and you have the first paper-draft in the first week, sometimes you start a project and half a year later you have to can it, nothing works out and if you keep on digging at this your career will be over. In both science and homicide, mostly luck decides whether your project will be 'dunker' or a 'whodunit', the remainder is experienced investigators who've developed an almost magical sense on what's going to work and what not.<br/><br/>There are other similarities - in the book the evaluation of homicide work is often criticised for being entirely numbers based, all that counts is the number of solved cases and that's it, doesn't matter how hard or easy the solve was. Unlucky detectives who've caught too many 'whodunits' by accident may have to leave homicide. In science, you're judged by the number of papers you put out, and by how often they're cited - you cannot go for 'moonshot' projects as you'll be working for years without publications and citations. It's a numbers game in both.<br/><br/>After that the similarities break down, of course - only detectives are carrying the burden of a small child's murder.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He does so while keeping away from the 'weird Japan' cliches, as most culture have created stories to explain their reality - think of Germany's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinzelm%C3%A4nnchen'>Heinzelmaennchen</a>, or Australia's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnoartina'>Adnoartina</a>. It's just that while Germany mostly forgot their stories and Australia's colonization destroyed and forcibly shifted a lot of culture Japan was fortunate enough to keep these stories going, to the point of every small island town having their own stories, or variants of those.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Thinking about the genesis of yokai, then, is really a philosophical problem: it helps us explore how human beings struggle to grasp, interpret, and control the world around them.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The second part of the book is a yokai encyclopedia which serves as examples for the first part of the text, with numerous yokai who serve as examples for humans making sense of their surroundings. There are yokai who make unexplainable noises around the house (<a href='http://matthewmeyer.net/blog/2013/10/19/a-yokai-a-day-yanari/'>Yanari</a>), yokai who watch you with their many eyes so you feel watched (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokumokuren'>Mokumokuren</a>), and so on.

Here Foster accidentally traces the steps of the yokai remix culture starting hundreds of years ago. You have people telling each other stories, then folklorists started to write down these stories while inventing their own yokai to add (what happened to the Grimm's Fairy Tales between the first and second edition is another example for this in Germany), then later authors expand on the early authors' works while changing and expanding, and now you have manga artists who take these 300 year old drawings and update them, add their own details or reimagine them completely, Shigeru Mizuki probably being the most famous for that inside of Japan.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But because yokai emerge from the process of thinking through the unknown, they can perhaps offer a small metaphor for considering these immense challenges. As I have argued implicitly throughout this book, yokai are born from the dual acts of reading and writing the world around us; they develop from symbiotic processes of <i>interpretation</i> and <i>creation</i>.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: people interested in people<br/><br/>P.S.: I have to say I'm jealous of Foster getting to stay on tiny Japanese islands to interview old story-tellers for his work, that sounds amazing.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You’ve acquired knowledge of the philosophical principles that you ought to accept, and have accepted them. What kind of teacher, then, are you still waiting for, that you should delay any effort to reform yourself until he appears? You’re no longer a youth; you’re a full-grown man. If you’re now negligent and idle, and are constantly making one delay after another, and setting one day and then another as the date after which you’ll devote proper attention to yourself, then you’ll fail to appreciate that you’re making no progress, but will continue to be a layman your whole life through until you die. <br/>So you should think fit from this moment to live as an adult and as one who is making progress; and let everything that seems best to you be an inviolable law for you. And if you come up against anything that requires an effort, or is pleasant, or is glorious or inglorious, remember that this is the time of the contest, that the Olympic Games have now arrived, and that there is no possibility of further delay, and that it depends on a single day and single action whether progress is to be lost or secured.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Three books in one, all overlap, none actually written by Epictetus but by students of his - Discourses is in the form of monologues with occasional student questions and makes up about 3/4 of the collection, Fragments are a few aphorisms, and Handbook is somewhat of a FAQ of stoicism. They all overlap, and if you're pressed on time, the Handbook alone may be enough. The Discourses have some parts that are interesting as windows into a different time than for their philosophy (there's a whole chapter where Epictetus gets angry about a student who spends too much time on his looks - then there's another one later where Epictetus gets angry about some people being too dirty).<br/><br/>Epictetus certainly wasn't easy to discuss with, he's got a style of discussion which you nowadays see only on 4chan (""Whom do you want to please? The women? Then please them as a man. ‘Yes, but they like smooth-bodied men.’ Go hang yourself.""), but it's entertaining and easy to read - the gist being that we as humans have only a small sphere of choice where our influence counts, and that is inside us - everything outside that (including our body) is outside our sphere of choice, so why should we care about what happens there?

This is an amazing part. It's deliberately named after Foucault's biopolitics, except that under neoliberalism, the threat of bodily harm is eliminated. We believe ourselves to be free, but under neoliberalism, force is put on everyone in a much more nefarious, hidden way - you <i>think</i> you want to optimize yourself, or to become a better version of yourself, but in reality the system just wants you to become a better worker.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Das Ich als Projekt, das sich von äußeren Zwängen und Fremdzwängen befreit zu haben glaubt, unterwirft sich nun inneren Zwängen und Selbstzwängen in Form von Leistungs- und Optimierungszwang.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation: The I as a project, that believes itself to be free of external and foreign pressures, now subjugates itself to inner pressures in form of pressure to perform and optimize.<br/><br/>From there it becomes apparent just why there is no organized resistance to it, no resistance that has any overarching theme (think of the splintered message of Occupy) - in these times, classes have disappeared, the modern knowledge worker is 'ein selbstausbeutender Arbeiter seines eigenen Unternehmens', a self-exploiting worker of his own company. <br/><br/>I've seen these types of behaviors especially in two communities - programmers and scientists. Both work through the weekend - both are obsessed with improvement, self-measurement - both have side-projects etc. Scientists are the original self-exploiters, we've never really had a structure to protest against. If scientists go on strike all they do is sabotage their own product (has anyone written anything on what sociologists of work can learn about work from scientists?). The new knowledge workers have the same problem - if you're a digital nomad who works on contract-basis you have no power to change the system, you're your own boss in the worst sense.<br/><br/>Neoliberalism has trained that into everyone, and subjugates people even more through forced transparency - everyone who participates in social networks feels the quick reaction of the entire network to anyone who deviates from the 'mainstream'. Expulsion of deviants isn't a new thing, but the quick and easy spread via social networks makes this effect extreme.<br/><br/>The second half goes off on a tangent about <i>Big Data</i> and suffers enormously from the fact that the author completely believes the hype about Big Data - it describes a philosophy of Big Data that feels just wrong. For example, he calls the rise of statistics during Rousseau's time the 'first enlightenment' and the rise of Big Data (here sometimes 'dataism') as a second enlightenment. This completely falls for the Big Data hype, since to me Big Data is just statistics + a ton of hype. There is no difference! You still use the same old methods, just on bigger datasets. You still have to make sense!<br/><br/>Or this one:<br/><blockquote><br/>Dataismus ist Nihilismus. Er verzichtet ganz auf Sinn. Daten und Zahlen sind additiv und nicht narrativ. Sinn beruht dagegen auf der Narration. Daten füllen die Sinnleere.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation: Dataism is nihilism. It completely dispenses with reason. Data and numbers are additive and not narrative. However, sense depends on narration. Data fills the emptiness of sense.<br/><br/>This ties into my above criticism - the goal of all Big Data algorithms is to extract <i>sense</i> from the data, there's no dispensing of reason, they rely on coming up with a story first and then checking it.<br/><br/>Let's look at an example. I have a large dataset of DNA from cabbage. I want to use publicly available data from prior studies to predict what some of the stuff in my DNA is doing, predict genes, etc.  I run some fancy algorithms to search for the known sequences in my cabbage-set, and get about 100,000 genes. I start to look through the results, but some of them are hits for known genes involved in human eye color. How is that possible? Do I have blue-eyed cabbage? Of course not, my prior studies are just contaminated with human data. It's still up to me (and in some ways, the algorithm) to come up with a narrative, and to make sense from the stuff that we're actually seeing - that's the holy grail of all of big data! There is no 'data fills the emptiness', you can't rely on the data alone, no-one does. And that's what annoys me so much about the critique of Big Data here, it's critiquing a fantasy thing invented by coked-up MBAs for press releases in order to look stronger to make investors love them, not what Big Data actually is in reality.<br/><br/>Here's the worst sentence:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>»Quantified Self« etwa wird geradezu mit einer libidinösen Energie betrieben. Der Dataismus entwickelt insgesamt libidinöse, ja pornographische Züge. Dataisten kopulieren mit Daten. So spricht man inzwischen auch von »Datasexuellen«. Sie seien »unerbittlich digital« und hielten Daten »für sexy«.[49] Der digitus nähert sich dem phallus.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Rough translation: Quantified Self is being run with an almost libidinous energy. The dataism itself is starting to develop libidinous, pretty much pornographic attributes. Dataists copulate with data. Now people talk of 'data-sexuals'. They are supposed to be 'adamantly digital' and hold data to be 'sexy'. The digit is moving closer to the phallus.<br/><br/> ¯\(°_o)/¯  Han studied philosophy in Germany and it shows.<br/><br/>After this short excursion into bizarro land we're actually getting back into interesting stuff - Han starts to develop (yet incomplete) thought on how a person can react to psychopolitics, how he or she could develop a free life.<br/>It's a short book so the author doesn't go far, but hopefully a future book will.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I tried to read it in one evening but had to stop at 4am.<br/><br/>It's the story of how one US astronomer turned computer programmer (""astroinformatician""?) found a 75 cents bill for computing time he couldn't make sense of, how he traced that bill, found an intruder on his system, and how it took him months to untangle the web of systems the hacker used to disguise himself.<br/><br/>Stoll had a very interesting scientific way in which he approached the problem of an intruder, which resonated with me strongly: he kept neat lab-books of everything that happened, he thought clearly about each step, and all the little details they used to infer more about the hacker are splendid.<br/><br/>For example, on login the hacker kept on using ""ps -eafg"" to see who was logged in, but ""-f"" was superfluous under Berkeley Unix, which indicated that the hacker was used to AT&T Unix, which  wasn't used on the US West Coast. Therefore it was more likely that the intruder was from the US East Coast, or from abroad.<br/><br/>(Another fun thing about the age of this book - it's clearly written for the layman in 1989, so things that are completely basic today are explained in long terms - ""electronic mail"", for example)<br/><br/>It becomes a fun cat and mouse game - it's always the same intruder (who turned out to be <spoiler>urmel/Markus Hess from Germany</spoiler>), Stoll tried to get the US government involved, but no agency wanted to have anything to do with it - neither the FBI, nor the CIA, nor the NSA had anything to do with computer break-ins, there were no laws yet, nothing (the events in this book happen around 1986-87, I was just a few months old).<br/><br/>It's great fun to read how each step in the plan worked out, how Stoll laid traps, each step in his thinking is detailed (the joys of writing everything down!).<br/><br/>You'll especially love this if you (like me) grew up fascinated with German ""hacker culture"" of the late 80s, early 90s, back when the Chaos Computer Club started to become a name. I got the biggest smile from this little dialogue:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Can you identify who's breaking in?""<br/>""One guy uses the pseudonym Hagbard. Another, Pengo.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm pretty sure every German ""computer person"" knows who hagbard was. We've all seen the movie ""23"", and if you haven't, you greatly owe it to yourself, it's one of my favorite German movies (even Robert Anton Wilson, who co-wrote ""Illuminatus!"", has a small part playing himself). It portrays the KGB hacks from hagbard alias Karl Koch and his friends, which is closely connected to the story of this book, but the movie focuses on Koch, while the book focuses on the systems Hess broke in. I guess focusing on Koch made for a more interesting story - he had a relatively large cocaine habit, and he was found burned to death, with no suicide note.<br/><br/>Stoll didn't like the CCC at all - in the book he repeatedly calls them vandals, I guess because back then, it was just a couple of kids messing around, not particularly knowing what they were doing. Nowadays the CCC advises the German government on technical security matters. The Chaos Communication Congress is one of the best and biggest technology conferences in Germany (I'm proud that I once held a little talk there at an ungodly hour together with <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5925863-bastian-greshake"">Bastian Greshake</a>/@gedankenstuecke).<br/><br/>Another interesting side-note is that some currently very famous ""computer people"" appear shortly - such as Paul Graham and Robert T. Morris, who have since then founded several companies and are now known for ycombinator, one of the biggest Internet startup seed funding companies (possible more for ycombinator's social news site, <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com"">Hacker News</a>)<br/><br/>If you want to read a more technical side of this, Stoll first published a paper: <a href=""http://pdf.textfiles.com/academics/wilyhacker.pdf"">Stalking The Wily Hacker</a>.<br/><br/>I wonder how much the events in this book, and the book itself, made Snowden's revelations possible...

Divorce was rarely possible but even if you pulled that off you were dead to society. In this case, the main character Jude has a babyscare at a young age and has to marry Arabella for an unhappy marriage- Arabella quickly goes off to Australia, Jude runs into his cousin Sue, they share many similarities, but she gets hitched to her boss. Sue and boss split up again, and Jude and Sue live together (it's implied that there's no sexual component, in the beginning), but both are ostracized from society and their downfall begins.<br/><br/>(there's a fun and judging word for that kind of relationship in German: 'Wilde Ehe', wild marriage, it's not a common word anymore. There's also the even more amazing 'Bratkartoffelverhältnis' = fried-potatoes-relationship, I assume a non-sexual relationship just for the food?)<br/><br/>Luckily the book doesn't focus on that alone, it would be boring to the modern reader who's used to a different society (some aspects of this oppressive world are still alive today of course, like destructive gossiping [1]). The other, more interesting focus of the book is characters - psychologically Jude and Sue are amazingly well-drawn characters. One or two minor characters only exist to repeat the standpoints of society and the poor people exist to speak the truth, but the remaining 'cast' is complex and torn apart and contrasting and so on, especially Sue is an enigma (but then again, I'm a man, what do I know). <br/><br/>Most of the book is from Jude's point of view and it's amazing how sneaky Hardy shows that (to me) Jude is an egotist without ever explicitly mentioning it. Here's an example. It's still early and Sue and Jude haven't really 'done' anything with Sue still apparently just seeing a cousin in Jude, but Jude had never told her of his prior and still valid Terra Australis marriage (first red flag!).  She later sends him a letter saying that her marriage will be in a few weeks and asks him to give her away at the altar since he is her only living relative, and this is how he reacts:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and later<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>How could Sue have had the temerity to ask him to do it - a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Now it's equally likely that she really does need a relative for the ceremony, or (what I prefer) maybe she needs the symbolism of him giving her away as a final line below their not-even-relationship, and to give him a chance to say 'this chase is over for me, I'm giving her to her husband'. <br/><br/>But instead he can only focus her request on himself, for him only <i>his</i> actions can cause consequences, he cannot see the world from her eyes at all (we return to the theme of the smart idiot). There are many minor things like this strewn throughout the book, and it's amazing skill from Hardy that Jude comes off as such a likable person, if you don't pay attention these minor things will float by. It's harder to judge Sue, the reader rarely sees her inside world.<br/><br/>Towards the end the book becomes a bit unfocused, around the arrival of the son. Let's call him Tim Burton because every line of his sounds like it should be enacted by a pale stop-motion puppet: 'I should like the flowers very very much, if I didn't keep on thinking they'd be all withered in a few days!'. Around that area the fun psychology stops, from there it's the last few minutes of a slow motion train crash. <br/><br/>Some other things are neatly pulled off by Hardy: I didn't even question that Jude and Sue only want the kinds of jobs where you have to be 'honorable', for them it's either improving church buildings or teaching children, nothing else works. Of course they can't find work! If they'd just opened a dodgy pub the book would have been short.<br/><br/>The <spoiler>hanging of the children</spoiler> is what breaks the camel's <s>neck</s> back and makes Sue 'turn' - she cannot deal with it and her defense to society 's demands breaks down completely, she 'sees the errors of her ways'. Jude does it differently - he gets very drunk for very long. Ever got so drunk you woke up and were married to your mean ex-wife again?<br/><br/>[1] Fun story: I'm from a small-ish 6000 people town. A few years ago my father received a call. The caller had just heard a rumor that the prior Sunday, my mother had been seen in the city with a young man - had she taken a lover?<br/>The young man was me, I was visiting from university, and people didn't recognize me.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It is an extraordinary miracle that we have escaped it until now.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Hojoki is a very short memoir of Chomei, who built himself a tiny hut in the forest to live out his life. Essays in Idleness is about 200 short aphorisms and stories written by Kenko about all kinds of things, sometimes pertaining to Imperial life in the 14th century, sometimes about Buddhism, sometimes about life and love.<br/><br/>Compare how withdrawn Hojoki is:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The hermit crab prefers a little shell for his home. He knows what the world holds. The osprey chooses the wild shoreline, and this is because he fears mankind. And I too am the same. Knowing what the world holds and its ways, I desire nothing from it, nor chase after its prizes. My one craving is to be at peace, my one pleasure to live free of troubles.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>with the more worldly Essays:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If you can never liner beneath the clouded moon on a plum-scented evening, nor find yourself recalling the dawns when you made your way home through the dew-soaked grasses by her gate after a night of love, you had best not aspire to be a lover at all.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Hojoki is concentrated and short and great - the Essays are more fun exactly because they're so random and all over the place, with content like what direction a particular Chinese temple pointed at, 'don't sniff antlers because there's bugs there that eat your brain', the nature of thoughts:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The emptiness of space allows it to contain things. The fact that thoughts can come crowding into our mind at will must mean that 'mind' is actually an empty space too.

Like players on a stage, these paintings were meant to be viewed from a distance; and they have a double existence: up close, a baffling semaphore of dots, dashes and blots that resolve, from farther away, into monumental rearing figures.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The story of Snare has been told numerous times in other formats - discovery of a masterpiece for cheap in a dusty corner, subsequent rise to stardom, obsession, <spoiler>it all comes crashing down, disappearance</spoiler>. <br/><br/>It's surprisingly interesting to see how hard it was to assign a painter to a specific painting without x-rays and chemistry, and how chaotic the art-world's knowledge was: some paintings got misassigned to a painter, who was subsequently known for painting in the style of those wrongfully assigned paintings, leading to correct paintings not being assigned to the artist (still a huge problem in biology, ""garbage in, garbage out"").

The transitions of kings-as-states to sovereign nation states saw a decline in power for the pope, yet religious feelings were more popular than ever. Was the industrial revolution driven by invention, or by a drastic change in consumers' demands? Can you even answer these questions?

There is no obligation to accept one or the other in its entirety: a selection can be mixed and matched according to individual taste.""<br/><br/>There's so much here, it's just <i>dense</i> with interesting and well-prepared information, here's an interesting observation which in my opinion fits the current atmosphere of a ""post-truth"" public sphere which focuses more on feelings than on facts, quoting Schiller:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Enlightenment by means of concepts could not influence the character of mankind, for most humans are moved to take action by their feelings. So the seeds of rational perception will wither where they fall unless the soil has been prepared by the emotions and imagination: ‘The way to the head must be opened through the heart.’ And that was the task of aesthetic education, to pave the way for the transition from ‘rule by mere forces to rule by laws’.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I feel that this is important - in the last 20,30,40 years we as ""Western society"" have shifted our view of what constitutes a ""citizen"" not as a participating member of society, but as an excellently-trained employee. ""The seeds of rational perception"" have stopped withering since they don't even get a chance to touch the ground.

He slowly introduces the reader step by step into how (basic) statistics works, he takes a tiny step into new knowledge and then immediately gives you tons of examples for this tiny new step so that you can understand what's going on - it's amazing from a didactic standpoint, because ever so slowly, without ever stating so in the beginning, he deduces the ""basic"" logic behind hypothesis testing.<br/><br/>Here's one example of the many examples showing the pitfalls, from the chapter on the problems behind describing reality with statistics:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Every fall, several Chicago newspapers and magazines publish a ranking of the “best” high schools in the region, usually on the basis of state test score data. Here is the part that is laugh-out-loud funny from a statistical standpoint: Several of the high schools consistently at the top of the rankings are selective enrollment schools, meaning that students must apply to get in, and only a small proportion of those students are accepted. One of the most important admissions criteria is standardized test scores. So let’s summarize: (1) these schools are being recognized as “excellent” for having students with high test scores; (2) to get into such a school, one must have high test scores. This is the logical equivalent of giving an award to the basketball team for doing such an excellent job of producing tall students.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's more about the intuition behind statistics, the various ways it can go wrong, than about the actual methods involved - it goes through standard deviation, standard error,  confidence intervals, regression analysis, normal distribution, inference, that's mostly it, the math itself is in the appendix.<br/><br/>If you want to learn all about the methods of statistics and how to interpret them, I'd still recommend Motulsky's [b:Intuitive Biostatistics|1037459|Intuitive Biostatistics, First Edition|Harvey Motulsky|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1387704318s/1037459.jpg|1023807].

Warlock has come into some money so it's citizens start to think of prosperity and how to keep it.

Sometimes it's a travelogue, sometimes it's a summary of politics, sometimes an Internet-based walk in the country. The second part is the actual history, sometimes it skims, sometimes it's as detailed as possible, followed by the last part, which is the relevant country's place in modern historiography, which often takes place as a lament on how forgotten the country is, or how wrong and incomplete various encyclopedia's entries are.<br/><br/>Sometimes this pattern is broken to hilarious effect - the chapter on Byzantium starts with a lament on what a bad rep Byzantium got from Renaissance individuals, a critique of Orham Pamuk in that he seems to have forgotten his city's history past his grandfather's generation, and when you expect the history to start it just says ""how do you expect me to summarize 1300 years of history in so few pages?"" and ends.<br/><br/>The book is at best when I got so immersed details of forgotten places, in places where Davies' humor really came out, that I thought I was reading a love-child of Borges and Calvino, a contest of trying to come up with the most ludicrous history possible:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>At this juncture, a clear head is necessary to disentangle the multiple coincidences of names. [...] In order to perpetuate the intimate relations of the courts of Toledo and Barcelona, the sister of Juan II of Castile was married off to Alfonso of Aragon, while the sister of Juan II of Aragon married Juan II of Castile. Both of these brides were called Maria; they were first cousins, and each of them married a first cousin. After their marriages, Princess Maria of Castile became Queen Maria of Aragon, and Maria of Aragon became Maria of Castile. The phrase ""keeping it within the family"" gains new significance.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On the other hand, the book is at its worst when it suffers from information overload. I think Davies often had to decide between ""pop-history"" and ""reference work"", and when in doubt, went for the reference (this fits to the laments in many chapters' third parts - better to get it right for future historians than to sacrifice ""endangered"" information on the altar of reading flow, I'd say). One minor example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[...] a broad band of territory was annexed stretching from Podolia and Volhynian Lutsk on the Polish border to Chernigov and Bryansk on the confines of Muscovy. Brest on the River Bug was captured, together with the district of Polesie beyond the Bug.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>What? Where??? I typed it down and immediately forgot everything.<br/><br/>So what makes this book important? In my view it has a lesson to teach, even if you quickly forget all about the minor details of the long-lost lives of monarchs in backwater kingdoms. Nowadays with more refugees coming in while a tone-deaf elite cuts social systems all around the world, the nationalistic voice gets louder and louder. However, (at least in Germany), these parties just reference the latest ""layer"" of history, while forgetting, ignoring, or simply not knowing about all the previous layers. I come from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernkastel-Kues"">here</a> - what ""people"" am I supposed to feel connected to? Let's see:<br/><br/>Various Celtic people used to run the place - then came the Romans and we became Germania Minor/Major (as featured in De Bello Gallico), just half an hour from the Limes protecting us from the unwashed Barbarians of the rest of what is now Germany, and we still have many Roman structures standing around; then Völkerwanderung happened and another bunch of Germans took over the place and we became part of Francia; <br/><br/>then came the Holy Roman Empire and the Nine Years' War; then Napoleon's armies took over for a few decades (it's still culturally so close to France that much of my childhood's dialect consists of loanwords from French, like ""Juppen"" from <i>jupon</i>, or ""Merzisch"" from <i>merci</i>, plus snails are delicious); then came the Kingdom of Prussia (somewhere in this time-area Bernkastel was joined to Kues, like Buda was joined with Pest); The Deutscher Bund; most of the fighting of World War I happened not too far away; then came the Nazis (we used to have a Synagogue - only a small path with the name of Synagogue remains, it was burned down during the Reichskristallnacht), then American troops, followed by French troops (the market place still has one house with bullet holes - not to show how terrible war is, but because the owner is too stingy to fix it, just as his father was) and under the Allied-occupied regions it belonged to France, then to the BRD again, which is where we're at now, for now. What am i now? French? German? Roman? Celtic? Francian? Do I have to care?<br/><br/>Germany is a complex place with complex history (as this book shows for Prussia's history alone - did you know there were several Prussias? And one of them was closer to Poland than to Germany?), all countries are complex places, with borders that are there for historical reasons (""let's just use this river here"") than because of a shared culture, or a perfectly shared history, or a shared language. Divisions happened almost randomly, and then disappeared again. Two generations ago people of Bernkastel used to hate people of Kues; children used to meet on the bridge for stone fights. Whoever got knocked out was taken and kept for 24 hours by the children of the other side. That this dividing hatred has existed is completely forgotten, but ""luckily"" we're coming up with new divisions.<br/><br/>P.S.: At one point Davies collects confusion about the different names for early Slavic groups as ""nomenclatural cacophony"".

The first essay ""Reflections on War"" tries to update Clausewitz's teachings with modern warfare. Eco ""updates"" the model of information flow in wartime, since nowadays it's not two big sources of information anymore. Instead, Eco models this flow as a neural network, where each interested party is a node in a network, with its own interests and impact on the entire network (machine learning says hi). This is a very interesting model - I can't even name all parties who have boots on the ground in Syria, let alone all the international parties who have vested interests. <br/><br/>This structure makes the patterns, shifts, outcomes of the conflict hard to impossible to predict, which is very different from what Clausewitz taught. It's especially fun when you've had some experience with Artificial Neural Networks, which have the same underlying model, but that one is used for training or pattern matching.<br/><br/>The last essay on internationalism and multi-culturalism is great, and I can really feel what a loss Eco's death meant for modern European thought in times of a profound shift to the right:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The most dangerous form of intolerance is precisely the kind that arises in the absence of any doctrine, fueled by elemental drives. This is why it cannot be criticized or curbed by rational argument. The theoretical foundations of <i>Mein Kampf</i> can be confuted by a battery of fairly simple arguments, but if the ideas proposed in it have survived and continue to survive all objections, it is because they are founded on uncontrolled intolerance, which is immune to all criticism.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The other three essays are less interesting: how to define fascism, and trying to define what all fascist movements have in common (""Ur-Fascism"") - how the Italian press has developed, with some interesting reflections that fit to all all media (""On The Press"") - how morality can develop without a religion (""When the Other Appears on the Scene"").",,,1,,,0,,,,,

We are concerned about the extraordinary government intervention in promoting Anzac Day, most of which has occurred without people knowing its true extent. We are also concerned about the misrepresentation and forgetting of our broader history. History runs counter to myth-making.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As a German reader living in snake country, Anzac day is a weird thing - could you imagine hundreds of Germans traveling to Poland every year to commemorate the German invasion? Yet Australians do that, ever since the late 90s, when the conservative Howard government (when isn't an Australian government conservative?) decided to move away from the icky Australia Day (a.k.a Invasion Day) and focus more on war commemoration, with all the US-American kitsch it entails (<br/><br/>Thanks to this I've learned a lot about how Anzac day started, and how the young Australia fought strongly about war issues (something which doesn't happen <i>at all</i> nowadays, despite a large involvement in overseas wars), and how organizations such as the RSL fought for pro-patriotism - for the longest time I thought RSLs are a chain of pubs focusing on slot machines (=pokies), it took quite a while until I learned that these are gathering places for veterans (what a strange idea! building a bunch of large gambling pubs for possibly traumatized ex-soldiers) from a huge organization that used to lobby for forced conscription and to have communism outlawed.<br/><br/>Lots of interesting side things (the near-split of Western Australia over war discussions, the facts that Australia had practically no say in WW1, that Gallipolli was an invasion and not some kind of defense of Australia [from what?]), but sometimes too repetitive, not always focused on the message (that's what happens when you have several authors). Interestingly, this book is the first book on history that I've read that extensively cites blogs and Internet comments as sources for the vox populi. These comments help the book to make a good distinction between the terrible and lazy Australian political rhetoric and the feelings of the actual population - there's a large rift in between.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As our political leaders increasingly mimic the public performances of American politicians, smiling and waving to the cameras as they pass through the church gates on Sunday morning, one wonders if the Anzac revolution has occurred not because we are a post-Christian society, but because we live in a time of religious revival. Before Anzac, we bow down, we close ranks and we remain silent.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Goethe complains about how some contemporary writer is bad in this or that way, then Eckermann comes up with an example of how Goethe did that thing much better in one of his plays, and then both vehemently agree for a page or two.<br/><br/>You have to see it this way: a young, self-taught guy from a poor background who has never finished any schooling or higher degree, who yearns for a career in the arts meets a famous man at the end of his life, a man whose time in the mainstream is over, who is maybe yearning for some attention from the younger German generations. The third book is much better, written a few years after Goethe's death, there's more distance between Eckermann and Goethe which leads to a cooler description of what was going on. The first two books spend so much time on Eckermann and Goethe agreeing that I'm surprised there's no slash fiction out there.<br/><br/>Some notes:<br/><br/>- Goethe's theory of color keeps on appearing over and over again (tl;dr: light doesn't consist of all colors, but colors appear when darkness and light mix) - Goethe was very angry that the ""crowning achievement of his life"" was being ignored by the mainstream. There are some fun implications for philosophy of science, and general crank-ism in there. A good theory doesn't <i>explain</i> phenomena, it <i>predicts</i> them; when Goethe's theory's predictions failed, he explained these failures away by saying that the eye is subjective, it ""wants to see what it sees"". Only a few pages later he complains about how no-one wants to ""let go"" of Newton's theory of color, but he couldn't do that with his own theory...

The other scientific research, for example into the metamorphosis of plants, worked out better - his methods and concepts like homology vs. analogy are still in use.<br/><br/>- It's interesting how often <a href=""http://the-toast.net/2016/04/19/portraits-of-lord-byron-in-order-of-lord-byron-ness/"">Lord Byron</a> appears - nowadays probably more known as the father of Ada Lovelace, one of the pioneers of computing. Goethe was immensely impressed with Byron, and he discusses Byron's successes and failures over and over again, the most discussed artist here. Schiller appears often too, for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>- I was easily lost in discussions between Eckermann and Goethe about their contemporary literature, much of which has been forgotten - have you ever read anything by August Hagen? Or August von Kotzebue, Friedrich August Wolf, Johann Gottfried Herder, St. Schütze (and many similar ones)? Me neither!<br/><br/>- You get a ""making of"" of Faust 2, which Goethe finished with Eckermann's help in the last few years of his life, including some insights into what Goethe thought about certain elements of the play (there's no specific symbolism behind the names of the characters Baucis and Philemon, just that their situation is vaguely similar to the characters in Ovid's writing), or how much Goethe owed to the Greeks, he kept on returning to Greek drama his entire life.<br/><br/>- It's also interesting how extremely confident Goethe was. Sometimes, that worked out immensely in his favor, you can't just write that many poems, plays, novels, and publish in several sciences without believing in what you're doing. In other times it didn't help - it doesn't look like he could admit errors (theory of colors, again). I wish I could be this much into my own work!<br/><br/>- lots and lots of interesting thoughts on arts, and on his work, the role of Germany, too much to fit in here. Goethe spent his whole life trying to perfect his life, his outlook and his personality, this gave me the first insight into why he's such a revered personality in Germany, and why Nietzsche loved him so much: Goethe was someone who never stopped improving himself. Goethe's personal philosophy of life and religion still has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>Anyway, once you get past all the fawning there are some extremely interesting thoughts and concept to be found here, and I really got to understand why Goethe is still such a towering figure in German culture.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's clearly aimed at non-philosophers - it's partially autobiographical, irreverent, honest, I'm jealous of Bakewell's effortless lively style, she has got the best explanations of phenomenology and existentialism I've come across. One aim of hers is to reintroduce existentialism to the ""modern"" reader: here was a generation of people who were obsessed with the anguish of choice, with authenticity and ""acting in bad faith"" as a reaction to societal forces. These themes have completely disappeared from modern popular discourse - irony and cynicism are certainly more popular.<br/><br/>I feel that the addition of Heidegger's recently published (and AFAIK not yet translated?)  <href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Notebooks"">Black Notebooks</a> would have enormously helped in Bakewell's assessment of Heidegger's character - there's more Nazism and antisemitism in Heidegger's ""private but slated for publication in some faraway future"" post-WW2 thought than was previously thought. Another minor thing is that the book noticeably loses focus and energy in the last few chapters, the chapter about Havel could have either been 2 or 3 chapters, or cut completely.<br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Heidegger, who admired Celan's work, tried to make him feel welcome in Freiburg.

In other areas he uses twin studies to argue <i>against</i> a gene-centric explanation of various human traits, but since 1993 numerous more (and bigger) studies using twins have been published that show a direct genetic link to various traits. Lewontin is very far in the ""not by genes alone"" corner, and many of the arguments he brings up have since become obsolete.<br/><br/>Sometimes however, he's bringing up arguments ten years too soon - he has arguments against Wilson et al.'s sociobiology that fit to the more modern evolutionary psychology, too: <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When we combine individual selective advantage with the possibility of kin selection and reciprocal altruism, it is hard to imagine any human trait for which a plausible scenario for its selective advantage could not be invented. The real problem is to find out whether any of these stories is true. One must distinguish between plausible stories, things that might be true, and true stories, things that actually have happened. [...] At the very minimum, we might ask whether there is any evidence that such selective processes are going on at the present, but in fact no one has ever measured in any human population the actual reproductive advantage or disadvantage of any human behavior.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or against the ""gay gene"":<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>First, the sociobiologist makes the assumption that homosexuals leave fewer offspring. This implies a description of human sexual behavior in which the world is divided between heterosexuals and homosexuals, one class that leaves offspring and the other that does not. This description, however, does not correspond to our knowledge of human sexuality. [...]<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Or on the problems of the then just-proposed Human Genome Project:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>And an average gene that is, say, 3,000 nucleotides long will differ between any two normal individuals by about 20 nucleotides. Who’s genome, then, is going to provide the sequence for the catalog for the normal person? [...] It would be necessary to look at a large population of normal and diseased people to see if one could find some common difference between them, but even this may not happen if the disease in question has a multiple genetic cause so that different people have the same disease for different reasons, even if all those reasons are a consequence of genetic changes.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>We've only now started to move away from the ""genome for everyone"" to ""personal genomics"" where everyone's genome is sequenced and analyzed, instead of compared to one reference genome. Here he also describes the problem we're 23 years later facing with genome-wide association studies - we need to recruit a ton of people that show a ""nice"" variation in the trait, and even then all we get is risk alleles, not actual genetic causes. The more genes are involved, the muddier it gets.<br/><br/>It's most interesting when he draws out the ideology behind various biological theories - Darwin's theory of natural selection, for example, can be interpreted in the light of the Victorian image of human society (""What Darwin did was take early-nineteenth-century political economy and expand it to include all of natural economy."").<br/><br/>Similarly, the ""modern entrepreneurial competitive hierarchical society"" with ""the priority of the individual over the collective"" is reflected in reductionist ""the gene did it"" theories that are nowadays accepted by society, but less by science. In other words, ideology subtly influences scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>Perhaps I shouldn't make the error to discuss this book from the point of view of modern science, but maybe from the point of view of how modern society interprets science, because there the ""only-gene""-centric view is still a common thing. <br/><br/>Just have a look at the weekly news - ""fat gene found"", ""gene for colon cancer"", ""gene for gray hair"" etc. pp. None of these genes need to cause these phenotypes, they may just under specific circumstances of the study appear more in individuals with that phenotype (there are various statistical technologies to minimize but not eliminate random influences, such as population history). It's still extremely hard to then find the actual A -> B, gene -> phenotype link. This is a problem since people are getting disillusioned about scientific progress - the news, politics, scientists tells them every week how much progress science makes, but they don't see the progress, they still die of the same old cancer.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's not a long read, but it hasn't aged well.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The Trojan War goes through the Iliad (and later, a few other sources), treats the sack of Troy as if it was a historic event (including characters - they probably did not have these names, but similar people probably did exist - ""Whether Helen’s face launched a thousand ships or none, queens of the Bronze Age wielded great power and kings made war over marriage alliances.""), and then goes from event to event - could this have happened this way? Do we have evidence for similar events around that time? Do we have archaeological evidence for similar wars happening at Troy?<br/><br/>An example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When the Greeks sacked the city, they  put Troy to the torch. Archaeology discloses that a savage fire destroyed the settlement level known as Troy VIi (formerly called Troy VIIa). [...] The inferno can be dated, according to the best estimate, sometime between 1230 and 1180 B.C., more likely between 1210 and 1180.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Bronze Age documents show that however brutal the sack of Troy may have been, it would have conformed to the laws of war. Cities that did not surrender would, if they were captured, be destroyed. This rule goes as far back as the first well-documented interstate conflict, the border wars between the two Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma between 2500 and 2350 B.C.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>All the while Strauss is a great narrator - often starting out with ""Now  imagine the scene"", going into living detail how it could have been, then switching over to the primary text with comparison of secondary sources.<br/><br/>The Trojan War is a good introduction to the Iliad and its events, it doesn't purport itself to be an academic work, in fact, the introduction explains most basic archaeology.

The younger generation then picks up the novel outlook from the start - ""science advances one funeral at a time"", as it is ascribed to Planck).<br/><br/>The short length of the talk/book makes criticisms of this style of thinking impossible; for example, you have to be extremely careful when choosing your data, and (un)conscious bias may make you dismiss evidence that you should have included, there can be a lot of (bad) subjectivity involved.<br/><br/>The other two laws are less applicable to a non-researching world - 1) outliers are the source of novel laws (as the ""weird"" motion of Mars while all other planets moved ""nicely"" was the source of Kepler's laws). <br/><br/>2) Human bias influences everything, even the mere act of a patient enrolling in a study introduces bias  - this is a bigger problem in medicine since you have two groups who are influenced by bias (the researchers <i>and</i> the patients).<br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The advent of new medical technologies will not diminish bias. They will amplify it. More human arbitration and interpretation will be needed to make sense of studies - and thus more biases will be introduced. Big data is not the solution to the bias problem; it is merely a source of more subtle (or even bigger) biases.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(I see that in bioinformatics often - there are many sources of false positive noise, which people usually discard (unmapped reads, repetitive regions etc.), the more noise, the more is discarded. We always throw away important information - in plants, resistance genes often carry many repeats, so I've had a few cases where we had to go ""dig in the garbage"" for our expected resistance genes)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The central thesis is that statelessness is a prerequisite for murder on such a scale, evidenced by the fact that Jews as citizens of functioning states (even of Germany) survived in greater numbers than Jews of destroyed states, such as Poland.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If Jews were to be removed from the planet, they first had to be separated from the state. As she [Hannah Arendt] wrote later, “one could do as one pleased only with stateless people.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On the way Snyder tries to right some myths - like the one that only Nazis killed in large numbers yet the Nazis managed to usually recruit the local population, or that the United States intentionally rescued Jews from genocide (the US gave 4,705 visas to Jews from July 42 to June 43, less than were murdered per day in 1942 in Treblinka).<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Age-old antisemitism cannot explain why pogroms began precisely in summer 1941. Such an explanation ignores the suggestive fact that pogroms were most numerous where Germans drove out Soviet power, and the obviously material fact that the instigation of pogroms in such places was explicit German policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The latter is explained with psychology - citizens who used to collaborate with the Soviets could ""clean themselves"" in the eyes of the Germans by participating in Pogroms - ""The Judeobolshevik myth, spread locally by militias, provided the perfect escape route for most Soviet collaborators"", a collective rewriting of history, it wasn't the Soviets, it was the Jews, with the added bonus of being able to take the houses and belongings of the murdered Jews.<br/><br/>Psychology plays a large part in the last third, which is more positive - why did various people and groups save Jews? It's almost as if the author included these parts to save his own belief in humanity.<br/><br/>The last chapter ""Conclusion"" is all about what we can learn from this - part of the panic that gave rise to Hitler was rising prices for food, which was much more expensive than nowadays thanks to the Green Revolution (Norman Borlaug is severely under-appreciated). We face similar problems with climate change, and if we don't change, we may fall into the same trap. We can't afford to chip away at the states, either in the name of neoliberalism, or in the name of the Left. We need states and their institutions:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When states are absent, rights—by any definition—are impossible to sustain. States are not structures to be taken for granted, exploited, or discarded, but are fruits of long and quiet effort. It is tempting but dangerous to gleefully fragment the state from the Right or knowingly gaze at the shards from the Left.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I could pull out quotes all day.<br/><br/>P.S.: Bonus-quip:<br/><blockquote><br/>The righteous few were behaving in a way that a norm based upon economic calculations of personal welfare would regard as irrational.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>P.P.S.: Did you know that Poland funded many early Zionist (and militant Zionist) organizations? I didn't! The history of these small paramilitary organizations like Betar forms a small, but very interesting part.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The Pirx short stories deal with that aspect - the pilot controls his space ship or lives in a moon colony, but he has to fully rely on his instruments, which (spoiler!) lie due to wrong measurements. 60 years ago that was a bit more revolutionary than today, where we're surrounded by unreliable technology, in a world where the GPS voice tells you to turn right where there is no road, or where we've got ""high tech"" automated assistants who misunderstand our words and call our parents, <i>again</i>, or where the automated threat assessor thinks you're a potential terrorist.<br/><br/>The excerpt from the Futurological Congress deals more with a reality you can't trust due to ubiquitous drugs and walks into Philip K Dick territory [1]. The narrator, who lives in a rich post-scarcity society, only knows about the ""common"" drugs, the ones that make teenagers more rebellious, adults more well-fit, and create moods as the situation demands them - but a meeting exposes him to an anti-drug drug, which reveals <spoiler>that the atmosphere is full of drugs, and reality is much less glamorous than thought - instead of post-scarcity it's rust and dirt and a society in collapse. He is later exposed to yet another drug that reveals yet another layer to reality, which is even worse (an ice-age), and so on, each step revealing a more terrible reality.</spoiler><br/><br/>The essays fit into that scheme - in a world where perfect virtual reality (he doesn't call it that yet) is possible, how can we trust reality? How would you distinguish reality from virtuality (you couldn't, if the simulation is good enough)? How much can you ""be"" Napoleon in such virtual reality without changing the layout of your brain? Wouldn't such a change in layout mean murder, as the original person disappears? How can you convince someone that they're <i>not</i> in a virtual reality, even though you've just disconnected them [2]? The minute that such technology is possible (and despite the hype around Oculus we're still a far bit off) we automatically stop trusting our reality.<br/><br/>We've had these questions again and again in popular culture since then with Matrix and Inception and whatnot, so reading these essays right now are more archaeological fun, to see how much he foresaw and how much is yet to come, how we could deal with that, and to see with what words Lem came up with for concepts that are now common-place.<br/><br/>P.S.: What is it with Lem translations being so much better in German than in English? The English versions are often wooden to the point that it even feels like reading English. Same goes for Strugatsky translations...<br/><br/>[1] Amusing anecdote you probably know: Both Lem and Dick ""worked"" in similar territory, but never met in person, Lem always stayed in Communist Poland. Lem published so many books and stories that Dick thought Lem wasn't a real person, but a communist committee publishing propaganda. He wrote a warning letter to the FBI about that.<br/><br/>[2]   like in that that Matrix fan-theory that says that the rebel's reality is just another layer of virtual reality custom-made for them, which would explain why Neo can later control machines even when he's ""outside"" the Matrix",,,1,,,0,,,,,

You get everything: life, many letters, other people's memoirs, the plays and novels themselves, including interpretations of Goethe's major works (one of the best, and again, complete Faust interpretations I've read so far). If you'd want a biography of Goethe, I'd recommend this - some problems where Safranski loves Goethe too much, you could easily write a much ""meaner"", more ruthless biography.<br/><br/>I don't really understand why the Germans love Goethe so much, and I still don't (maybe it's our ""Obrigkeitshörigkeit""/obedience to authority?). He was against the upcoming German state, but after his death the German state used him for his propaganda (as evidence of German uniqueness - similar to Japan's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonjinron"">Nihonjinron</a>).<br/><br/>Some other notes:<br/><br/>- Goethe often wrote to escape his <i>Lebensekel</i> (life-disgust), great word, which is the ""real"" reason of Werther's suicide (not the unlucky love affair as it's often made out to be).<br/><br/>- There's so much about Goethe's disdain for the new industrialism, a world that is ""too fast"" - I wonder how much of that is Safranski writing about 2013.<br/><br/>- Politically he was extremely conservative to the point of being cowardly. His monetary security was completely dependent on Karl August (Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, one of those tiny German kingdoms), so he was always for the ""old"" order and criticized the new democracy movements. Very German, I've met Germans who haven't changed their thinking since. Then when the French became the dominant power and Napoleon made Goethe a Chevalier in the Legion of Honour suddenly Goethe was pro-French. Always follow the money.<br/><br/>- It would have been much easier to make fun about Goethe's failed politics exercises. Goethe didn't see himself as an author, but for quite some time as a politician. Karl August gave him an elevated position in government based on personal friendship and admiration, but the large majority of government projects he started and attended were complete failures, partially due to Goethe having been such a political amateur. I can't help but feel jealous of Goethe's secure position - ""GOETHE: hey can I go travel Italy for a year or two while you keep on paying me so I can publish a book about it all?"" - ""DUKE KARL AUGUST: yes, of course, here's some more money"". Goethe was lucky: upper middle-class parents, lifelong admiration and employment by a Duke.<br/><br/>- There's a lot of interesting stuff in Goethe's philosophy about life: you recognize yourself because of the reflections your actions create from others, not from looking inward all day. You even need these reflections, you need others, you can't recognize yourself on your own (funny, typical Goethe's ego: ""don't bother with the reflections of opponents"", but imho sometimes opponents have a point of view you hadn't even considered!). The best life is a pursuit of knowledge.<br/><br/>Similarly interesting the views on religion - reminded me of Einstein's writings on religion, very Spinoza, there is no bearded guy in the clouds, the Godly is everywhere and inside you and is expressed by your actions and work. Everyday actions are an indirect service to God.<br/><br/>- Goethe's relation to science was more than questionable, and hampered by his own ego. He set out to disprove Newton (like that always ends well) and came up with a rather strange explanation of colors (roughly: colors happen when darkness is mixed with light), which he then pushed on anyone. Goethe sent his stuff to Lichtenberg who didn't include it in his physics textbook, which Goethe treated like a personal attack, he broke off all contact. Goethe even received a polarizer as a present, but he refused to use it (fear of having his pet-theory disproven?). If Goethe were alive today he would have one of those blogs ""disproving"" the theory of relativity.<br/><br/>- It's weird how often people got banned from kingdoms back then. Goethe used his influence to have a former friend banned, and others got banned for being too atheistic in public. Then again, German kingdoms were so tiny that a ban meant ""please ride your horse for half an hour in whatever direction, if you really want to come back, write a nice letter"".<br/><br/>- Here Humboldt appears only a few times, curious given that Goethe is such a large part of [b:The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World|23995249|The Invention of Nature  Alexander von Humboldt's New World|Andrea Wulf|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1452449264s/23995249.jpg|43595986].<br/><br/>Best bonus quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Ich habe nichts getan dessen ich mich rühmen könnte, manches dessen ich mich freuen darf.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translation: I have done nothing I could be proud of, but a lot I can be pleased with.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre"">Wikipedia article</a> has photos, it's NOT safe for lunch or work.<br/><br/>Chang wrote the book out of anger over the crime being either forgotten, or actively downplayed by the Japanese and it clearly shows in the book - there's lots of judgmental language (a ""brave crusader"" sues the Japanese government, the Chinese defended Shanghai with ""extraordinary valor"" etc.) so if you want a truly unbiased neutral account you have to read the Wikipedia article (edit: but I don't think the book distorts the facts). It's a very, very depressing book - first the history that led up to this massacre, then the massacre itself, several eyewitness accounts (including from the diary of the German John Rabe), and a bit on how the massacre is treated nowadays.<br/><br/>It's a slightly older book, some things have shifted since then - Ishihara Shintaro is quoted as a denier of the Rape of Nanking, after the publication of this book he became Governor of Tokyo (his Wikipedia article is mostly ""Other controversial statements"", like a mean version of Prince Philip) [1]. <br/><br/>I feel that in recent times, the issue of ""comfort women"" (forced prostitutes) has taken over the debate, especially since Japan finally started to pay some reparations to Korea in December 2015 (an issue that extends far beyond Korea - Chinese, Philippine, Vietnamese, Thai, Dutch, Australian etc. women were forced into prostitution, like <a href=""http://www.janbanning.com/comfort-woman-ellen-van-der-ploeg-passed-away/"">Ellen van der Ploeg</a>.)

The Japanese say ""our opponents come up with these lies to gain the upper hand in this conflict, make us look bad, and force money and concessions out of us!"", and the Korean and Chinese say ""the Japanese are still lying about their crimes, how can we trust them now?"". This won't end very soon, both sides are at a stalemate. It's a bit easier for Germany to recognise its own crimes because Germany is not fighting with Poland over resources, there is nothing to lose.<br/><br/>I've been reading the recent [b:Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning|23995415|Black Earth  The Holocaust as History and Warning|Timothy Snyder|https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1433433006s/23995415.jpg|43596108], and there are some good points on the destruction of the state as a prerequisite for an excess of violence which would fit very well here.<br/><br/>[1] If you're into Japanese literature this might interest you: In his younger days Ishihara was a good friend of [a:Yukio Mishima|35258|Yukio Mishima|https://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1213653898p2/35258.jpg], the guy in this <a href=""https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ishihara_Mishima.jpg"">this famous picture of Mishima</a> is Ishihara.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

A generous sharing of credit is the quickest way to build a healthy scientific community.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I'm stealing that rule!<br/><br/>- One of the best essays is the one summarizing the US military's  ""secret"" report on insurgents called <i>Oregon Trail</i>, which he had access to when he visited the RAND corporation:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The most important conclusion of the Oregon Trail study was that the rebels usually won if the empire spent most of its effort on military operations, but that the rebels usually lost if the empire spent most of its effort on political and social responses to grievances. It was obvious to anyone who read Oregon Trail that the American war in Vietnam was likely to be a losing proposition. Unfortunately, very few people had a chance to read it. By one of the worst abuses of the secrecy system that I ever encountered, the military authorities stamped the whole thing secret.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Wish I could read it! Even Wikipedia has only a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail_%28disambiguation%29"">dead link to a non-existing article</a>...<br/><br/>(This summary is part of a favorable review of Gladwell's David and Goliath, interestingly enough)<br/><br/>Recommended for: People looking for something smart to read",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It just works! And you're reading this while a few phagocytes kill off a parasite in your eyes, they just saved you from going blind, and you don't even know.<br/><br/>Parasite Eve fits a bit into the body horror genre (more famous for Cronenberg movies) - mitochondria aren't ""the powerhouse of the cell"", they're parasites that have been waiting from the day of the first phagocytosis. <br/><br/>In the story one of these parasite networks has ""developed consciousness"" (and telepathy and telekinesis and the ability to speak in italics), she's looking for a suitable host and a father of the next generation of ""mitochondrial eves"" (you know, maternal inheritance of mitochondria and whatnot). That father is - of course - a biologist so we get lots of fun details from the daily life of a biologist (there's a fun little bit where everyone's over the moon for just having been published in <i>Nature</i>, and who wouldn't be!). The monster appears like the mother at the end of ""Braindead"" [1], and is then defeated for some lousy reason, aaaand then the book's over, and in parts it's even exciting!<br/><br/>Now to the bad. The first half is extremely, ridiculously, who-needs-sleeping-pills dry. Here's an example:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The human body has a main abdominal artery and vein through which a great amount of blood flows. The arteries which supply blood to the kidneys extend from this main artery. Similarly, the kidney veins are linked to the abdominal vein. The abdominal artery and vein each fork out in the lower abdominal region and continue into both legs. The balloon-tip catheter had been inserted up through this lower arterial branch to reach the kidney extension, and the balloons then inflated to interrupt blood flow in the abdominal artery.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>And that's just a tiny excerpt! You can easily skip the first half of the book and the only thing you'll have missed is an in-depth manual on how to transplant a kidney. But maybe you need to know that? Maybe you're one of those doctors who faked their way into the operating theater, and now you're nervously making it up as you go along? Boy have I got the book for you!<br/><br/>Bonus cheese quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Toshiaki screamed. Something was being sucked out from the center of his genome.

A purely rhetorical question, that: modernity had ended in Western Europe some time ago.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>I once tried to get into Houellebecq [1], about 10 years ago, and back then his work seems to have been all about ""here's a bunch of sex with various people, oh no this is not fulfilling, we need monogamy, the end"". Not that interesting. The Map and the Territory does not fit into that pattern at all, luckily, it's more a character study of two sides of the same coin - Jed and Houellebecq himself, the first some kind of visual artist who drifts from photography to painting, the second a relatively successful French author who's hired to write the introduction to a catalogue of Jeb's work. <br/><br/>Both are extremely similar with little attachment to ""real life"", both have little to no friends and are drifting through life. Both have found success without really aiming for it, both just made their art when it came to them with no real aim to become rich or famous with it. <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There was truly in Beigbeder, as far as he could remember, something which could arouse affection and, already, the existence of “loved ones”; something that did not exist in Houellebecq, nor in him [Jeb]: a sort of familiarity with life.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>France, culturally and linguistically, always feels like a bit of a self-imposed island to me - the French language is imposed by law, and French modern books focus more on navel-gazing than anything else. Houellebecq nearly walks into that trap with a bit of too much satire of the French cultural elite, but he luckily looks past France. There's a bit of history of computing and Silicon Valley, Tocqueville, especially surprising to find a reference to Hakim Bey's Temporary Autonomous Zone. He even touches Jack Womack's territory in a few lines where some areas in Paris have devolved into some kind of proto-anarchy; but where Womack then walks into these territories and stages laser axe-fights between hopped up 13-year olds and Robocops, Houellebecq just mentions them and immediately leaves to focus on his characters. I guess this is something H. revisits in Soumission, I yet have to read that one.<br/><br/>The last third is a bit unnecessary, <spoiler>there's a brutal murder, and sadly the murder is resolved, and even more sadly the murderer is dead so that no (psychological) explanation is necessary</spoiler>, almost as if H. didn't know how to end the story.<br/><br/>[1] That first ""e"" has no earthly business in a last name",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As such, the community has developed into an almost religious cult-like thing around the ""start-up life"": ""why don't you work 22 hours a day, why don't you sleep under your desk, you have to pivot/disrupt/boot-strap/pitch/iterate/, why don't you follow our hero Zuckerberg/pg/Thiel, you have to become great <i>now</i>"" and more boring platitudes. The religious nature comes out in often-used terms like ""angel investor"" ( = someone who wastes their rich parents' money on an overvalued team, i.e., fantasy football with programmers).<br/><br/>Often a extreme fear of death comes out in these interviews and texts, now culminating in money not being focused on useless mobile apps, but on medical companies that treat death as a disease in the hopes of reversing or postponing your eventual demise (see for example <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com.au/ellison-thiel-also-trying-to-cure-death-2013-9?op=1"">here</a>).<br/><br/>This is where The Denial of Death comes in. Becker summarizes Otto Rank's life work into a straightforward chain of argument, which goes a little bit like this: <br/><br/>1. Man has a natural urge to heroism, someone who needs to justify their own existence as an object of value - this is due to his ""evolutionary and organismic constitution"" (nice hand-waving there).<br/><br/>2. Man is also the only animal that knows he is nothing but ""food for worms"", one slip in the shower and you're done for.<br/><br/>3. This creates an inner conflict as you have the ""God-like"" inner heroism and the outer shell of a sickly creature, and both these points collide in your existence.<br/><br/>4. The job of a child is to come to terms with this conflict by more or less learning to repress, and all adults have more or less repressed this conflict. This repression is in everyone, is healthy and expected. Only when you can't handle the repression or when it becomes too extreme do you run into problems with your existence - Becker/Rank discuss this with the example of artists and ""great"", but problematic men like Freud.<br/><br/>5. Along with the fear of death comes the fear of ""too much life"", when you know so much about your condition that it becomes too hard to bear:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Once you accept the truly desperate situation that man is in, you come to see not only that neurosis is normal, but that even psychotic failure represents only a little additional push in the routine stumbling along life's way. If repression makes an untenable life liveable, self-knowledge can entirely destroy it for some people.</blockquote><br/><br/>6. Can we escape this dilemma? No. One solution to handle it better is to become a Kierkegaard-ian ""knight of faith"", someone who has given the meaning of his/her life over to the creator (whoever/whatever that may be), someone who accepts death and life by becoming part of a bigger system. Unlike the ""gurus"" of psychotherapy, of religion etc. (there's a nice, negative discussion of the overlap of 70s psychotherapy and religious movements), there is nothing you can do to fix or to transcend the conflict in your existence. ""Men are doomed to live in an overwhelmingly tragic and demonic world.""<br/><br/>He does make a fun case that Christianity (the idealized Christianity, not the power-structure with its own mountain of problems) has found a nice way to ""sidestep"" these problems:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>This is the most remarkable achievement of the Christian world picture: that it could take slaves, cripples, imbeciles, the simple and the mighty, and make them all secure heroes, simply by taking a step back from the world into another dimension of things, the dimension called heaven. Or we might better say that Christianity took creature consciousness - the thing man most wanted to deny - and made it the very <i>condition</i> for his cosmic heroism.</blockquote><br/><br/>All of these arguments are straight out of the tradition of psycho-analysis; lots of interpretation, little supporting data. When Becker/Rank try to ""update"" Freud's ideas on transference by saying it's not the oedipal conflict of the child, but the fear of either death or of too much living, then you can't help but wonder if they're just trying to replace ""unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 1"" with ""unprovable, logically sounding chain of arguments nr. 2"".<br/><br/>The problems of pure interpretation become apparent in the last chapter when Becker tries to apply the above points on many mental diseases, and here scientific knowledge has long surpassed his points, and he (as he acknowledges) extremely oversimplifies. He says that depression is ""just"" a inability to cope with their fear of life and death, but by now we know that depression is caused by a whole spectrum of causes, from genetic predisposition, prolonged substance abuse, broken neuro-transmitters, vulnerability factors, social isolation etc. pp. Please, don't go up to people with mental illness and try to explain their illness with these 40 years old ideas.<br/><br/>My above points on ""start up culture"" can be interpreted from this chain of arguments - you have people who are aware of their death, but instead of repressing it or becoming part of something bigger than them, they fight death, something that's (according to Becker/Rank) not fight-able. Their example: If you live to 900 years instead of 90, then each accident becomes so much more grave, the fear of life becomes more extreme. Let's say you're supposed to die at 900, but you have a car accident and die at 80 - that means you ""lost"" 820 years. If you're supposed to die at 90 and you die at 80, you've lost ""only"" 10 years. What will happen is that people will worship security too much as each accident's impact will become extreme.<br/><br/>Bonus-quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Creation is a nightmare spectacular taking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of millions of years in the blood of all its creatures. The soberest conclusion that we could make about what has actually been taking place on the planet for about three billion years is that it is being turned into a vast pit of fertilizer. But the sun distracts our attention, always baking the blood dry, making things grow over it, and with its warmth giving the hope that comes with the organism's comfort and expansiveness.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like to think about their lives.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who can't read critically, or who immediately model their lives after everything they read. These ideas are fun to entertain, but it would be unwise to immediately accept them.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's not really ""hard-boiled"", for that the dialogue and humor is too absurd - it would, however, work very well as a stage-play. Some people do get murdered, some get shot. At times it's more like Douglas Adams' ""Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency"" (as when Doan describes how he makes his money), at other times it dabbles in hard-boiled (unassuming strangers are found to hide some deadly weaponry). Sadly the ending pans out exactly as expected, and overall there's nothing ""new"" here.<br/><br/>I originally found this in Monk's biography of Wittgenstein with the note that it was Wittgenstein's favorite fiction book. As with so many books, it's hard to tell from afar why someone loves a book. Sometimes a book finds you at exactly the right moment, and others won't understand. I still love Rosendorfer's Great Solo For Anton and as far as I know it's forgotten and out of print, interesting to no-one.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""Mr. Doan,"" Janet said, worried, ""are you sure you feel alright?""<br/>""Marvelous,"" Doan answered.<br/>""Well, I've never had much experience with intoxicants.

Can you look at evolution not through the lens of (population) genetics but through the lens of biochemistry, specifically, energy. Lane starts at the ""beginning"" - how come the last common eukaryotic ancestor already possessed so many complicated traits? He goes to introduce an origin of life that depends on energy in the form of protein gradients, and argues that life depending on protein gradients can only evolve under very constrained circumstances - therefore, life on other planets should evolve very similarly (I'm reminded of Gleick's The Information, making similar points about the development of writing). From there he goes on to hypothesize about the evolution of complex(er) cells, the interaction of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in the development of different life-spans and sexuality, and more.<br/><br/>There's a tom of interesting stuff here, it's definitely a novel perspective.<br/><br/>Some pet-peeves remain: for example, like Dan Brown Lane can't introduce scientists without giving them a positive adjective like ""eminent"" - you can't help but feel a bit ""propaganda'd"". In times it reads like Lane is channeling Sagan, and you can't help but feel that there was someone shouting ""isn't this amazing!?!"" while writing it - in other cases it's more like reading a textbook with very dry descriptions of the involved biochemistry.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Biologists, laypeople interested in the origins of life",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It goes from the basics, to using the query language Cypher, to some use-cases, internal technologies, and a quick primer on graph algorithms (Dijkstra's algorithm, A*).<br/><br/>Very American, the tone is overenthusiastic to the point of being hilarious:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>[...]graph databases lack the kind of schema-oriented data governance mechanisms we're familiar with in the relational world. But this is not a risk; rather, it calls forth a far more visible and actionable kind of governance.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Translated: It's OK to give children live hand-grenades. But this is not a risk; just give them some rules for handling explosives.<br/><br/>It's similar overenthusiastic in the benchmarks, and there's an absolutely unholy code-example showing how to extract all nodes from a range of dates with no comment that a whole page of code with several MATCHes for a date1 <= x <= date2 is a <i>bit</i> too complicated. Then again, the authors made the database and work for the company that makes all of its money with Neo4j. At times the book feels more like a company white-paper.<br/><br/>The later chapters get more interesting - testing using Java, technical details of the implementation, algorithms, architecture patterns, caching etc. I would have liked more technical details but these are out there (and there are a few useful paper and book recommendations, here too!)<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who want to get their feet wet with graph databases, but don't want too much of the technical details",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Oh, this kills you? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (Then again, there's at least one review here that says the relevant quote is cut to make it seem more extreme, but the relevant link is dead and not on Google)<br/><br/>- Saladin is portrayed as an extremely generous leader, someone who didn't slaughter or sell the population of a fallen city. However, was the generosity worth it? It made him look benevolent, and no plundering meant no income from the war. His pardoned enemies quickly regrouped, after his death his empire immediately fell apart, and the <i>Franj</i> regained some of their strength. On the other opposite, the concentrated brutality of the Mamluks was the force that after 200 years finally drove the Crusaders/Franj out of Near East.<br/><br/>- The Sunni/Shia conflict features prominently - and it still features prominently in our times, virtually unchanged.<br/><br/>- The sacking of the Assassin's library in Alamut makes me more sad than it logically should, so much unique knowledge lost (unlike the Library of Alexandria, which had copies of most of its content in other cities). <br/><br/>- Straight out of Sun Tzu's ""Art of War"", there are at least 20 cases where group A corners group B, and group B fights so full of despair that group A is routed. See for example Zangi's siege of Damascus.<br/><br/>- Most of the initial success of the First Crusade was more due to Muslim infighting, confusion, and political instability than due to any strategic or technical superiority (except for the Crusaders' full-body armor, which was worn only by the rich knights of the army).<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those who'd like to take up a different perspective from time to time.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

On his floor, just two doors down, is a dying Feynman, not far from that, Murray Gell-Mann's office - the relationship between both as well as their relative outlook on life is the undercurrent of this book, with a larger focus on Mlodinow's tapes of his conversations with Feynman (including many direct quotes). If you've read Feynman's autobiography, then you won't discover much new here - the outlook Feynman describes here has been thoroughly. <br/><br/>There are some choice quotes though:  <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>""But the theory has been around for fifteen years"", I said. <br/><br/>""Okay"", he [Feynman] said, ""So not only is it bullshit, it is old bullshit.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On the basis of his promising thesis Mlodinow got a very strange job at Caltech - no supervisor, no grant attached to a specific project, no teaching, pure research freedom. Personally I'd say that would work amazingly with 10% of all scientists - the other 90%, including me, would turn into a pillar of salt from pure stress. The ""pep talk"" described here given by the head of school listing all these famous Nobel Prize winners just would make everything worse, and I could only nod when Mlodinow described his gradually worsening impostor syndrome (""what if my thesis was just a one-off outlier?"").<br/><br/>What he describes here is how he started to think of the role of a scientist and science (a bit late!), and how the gruffy conversations, in contrast to Gell-Mann's outlook, helped Mlodinow shape his outlook on his work and life. He actually quit science and went into writing for TV!<br/><br/>I'd have given it five stars if the language wouldn't wander off too far into the formulaic soap opera language (""I found the answers I sought about the nature of science and the scientist.

It's so much more intuitively obvious.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Star Trek's techno-babble is at least internally consistent!<br/><br/>Yet Stross seems to have worked in IT in a large organisation, there's quite a few people who might find this funny:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Harriet has been having problems with her email system and asked my advice; I don't know quite what went wrong, but she ended up blowing five days of the departmental training budget attending a course on sendmail configuration. Took her three weeks to stop twitching every time somebody mentioned rules.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some more ""bad"" things: Every character speaks and behaves exactly the same, the protagonist's love interest is a nerd Gibson wet-dream (hot! goth clothes! stays up all night to read Knuth! etc. pp.), the protagonist just knows stuff the story needs him to know (he goes from system administrator to knowing how to defuse an atomic bomb in ~80 pages), several glaring plot-holes (why is there a experienced secret specialized anti-paranormal SAS unit but all of them see magic for the first time when the protagonist uses it?), framing the holocaust as a needed sacrifice for a death spell is pretty bad taste, and more. But well, as the afterword says (weirdly defensive): ""Nobody forced you to read it by holding a gun to your head"". <br/><br/>I guess fans of Dresden Files or The Martian might like this, similar humor. Or system-admins who know the BOFH archive by heart.<br/><br/>P.S.: Interestingly, there's a joke about GCHQ listening on Americans while the NSA listens in on the British so both agencies can exchange intel without doing something illegal - something which was officially proven about 8 years after this book came out.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Lovecraft, and it shows - both ""universes"" overlap a bit (the Necromonicon and Yog-Sothoth make an appearance here, for example), but Smith also came up with his own books. There are two differences: Smith vocabulary [1] is humongous compared to Lovecraft. Where everything ""moves blasphemously"" for Lovecraft, Smith does this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>All the hideous things that had swarmed upon me beneath the cacophonous beating of those accursed gongs, drew near again for a moment; and I looked with fearful vertigo into hells of perversity and corruption. I saw an inverted soul, despairing of good, which longed for the baleful ecstasies of perdition. No longer did I think him merely mad: for I knew the thing which he sought and could attain; and I remembered, with a new significance, that line of Baudelaire's poem - ""L'enfer dont mon coeur se plait.""<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(which, by the way, is a misquote as the footnotes explain). <br/><br/>Smith has a much better rhythm and feels much more natural to read, compared to Lovecraft who often feels clunky or forced. But, Smith just isn't as original in ""worldbuilding"" as Lovecraft - contrary to Lovecraft Smith's stories are often set in a relatively generic fantasy world in which some evil wizard does something evil (for added strangeness everybody's name starts with an X or a Z), stories that could have worked in One Thousand and One Nights, but feel weird and not very original coming from a relatively recent American author. I felt similar about the prose poems and the poems, but Smith's language makes it worth.<br/><br/>However, Smith's overflow of adjectives and adverbs doesn't always work out:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Xeethra plunged incontinently into the dark cave.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of Lovecraft, or those who love overflowing language<br/><br/>[1] As a side: The German word ""Wordschatz"" is so much better than your ""vocabulary"".

I would not recommend it to biologists or those without any programming experience - for that, it assumes to much of the reader - but for programmers thinking of going into bioinformatics, or bioinformaticians who've dabbled a bit with the shell, this is a gold-mine.<br/><br/>It starts off with good advice like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In teaching bioinformatics, I often share this idea as the Golden Rule of Bioinformatics: NEVER EVER TRUST YOUR TOOLS (OR DATA) This isn’t to make you paranoid that none of bioinformatics can be trusted, or that you must test every available program and parameter on your data. Rather, this is to train you to adopt the same cautious attitude software engineers and bioinformaticians have learned the hard way.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>and how to structure and document your projects, then a short intro to using bash, one chapter on git, a bit of ssh, working with data, various useful Unix tools (you know, awk, sort etc.), a VERY dense introduction to R, bioconductor, GenomicRanges, dplyr, ggplot2 (this felt like the bulk of the book, possibly because R is the one thing I had the least experience with from the stuff in the book), an intro to some common file-formats like fasta/fastq/sam/bam and some of their related tools (samtools/bedtools), then a bit of streaming data, and closing with a quick introduction to SQL using SQLite. All of that crammed into ~300 pages! It's a dense book.<br/><br/>Luckily he introduces only the ""timeless"" stuff, the tools that should still be around in a few years. There's no introduction to read aligners here, for example, these change all the time. The tone is lively and direct and not overcomplicated, but I can't stress this enough, absolute programming beginners <i>will</i> struggle. For those there are other introductory books (like Haddock/Dunn's 'Practical Computing For Biologists').<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're an advanced bioinformatician somewhere at the end of your PhD or even past that much in this book may bore you; in that case, it's always nice to see how colleagues go about their work. For example, why have I always googled SAM flags like some caveman instead of simply using 'samtools flags'?<br/><br/>Yet this book fills a niche that I've always wanted to see a book in - the relatively tool-agnostic, ""how to go about your job in the most efficient way possible"" niche.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

This servers as a very good introduction to Wittgenstein's philosophy - his writing is famously concentrated down to sentences as concise as possible. Here you get explanations from discussions with other philosophers, or from lectures he held.<br/><br/>Some things I noted:<br/><br/>- Many ""famous"" names appear here. Hitler was in a school class with Wittgenstein in Vienna for one year; later on, Popper, Feyerabend, Turing are all discussing/fighting with Wittgenstein. And of course, Wittgenstein's professors at university like Russell or Frege feature prominently, up to their eventual falling-out.  <br/><br/>- Monk manages to show all the times Wittgenstein himself was weirdly naive without any judgment; I can't see how a 50-ish year old Professor of Philosophy can seriously entertain the notion of becoming a ""manual laborer"" in Soviet Russia (""the life of a manual labourer in Russia was the epitome of a life without treacle""). Soviet Russia didn't really want him, quote Monk: ""The one thing that was not in short supply in Soviet Russia was unskilled labour."" However, Monk defends Wittgenstein's remarks to Drury on the eve of Austria's Anschluss to Hitler's Germany as Wittgenstein trying not to worry Drury too much about Wittgenstein's family's situation. I'm not convinced.<br/><br/>- The <i>intense</i> part of Wittgenstein's personality is very well portrayed here. It was apparently very hard to be around him or hold ""small-talk"", and in philosophical discussions his directness was often abrupt to the point of being rude. This is how he wanted to prepare for a wedding:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Early in the summer he invited Marguerite to Norway to prepare, as he thought, for their future life together. He intended, however, that they should spend their time separately, each taking advantage of the isolation to engage in serious contemplation, so that they would be spiritually ready for the new life that was to come.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As expected, she left after two weeks.<br/><br/>- He wouldn't survive in today's academia - he published little to nothing, most is published posthumously. His teaching was kept ""under wraps"":<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In order to keep his class down to a size with which he felt comfortable, he did not announce his lectures in the usual way in the <i>Cambridge University Recorder</i>. Instead, John Wisdom, Moore and Braithwaite were asked to tell those students they thought would be interested about the classes. No more than about ten students attended.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>This is impossible in the age of standardised tests, degrees and the Bologna process.<br/><br/>- Wittgenstein's remarks and Monk's expansion about logic and concepts not being as simple as logicians wanting them to be are eye-opening, recommended reading<br/><br/>- In his remarks about language I'm reminded of Stanislaw Lem's SF:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>This is because the commonality of experience required to interpret the 'imponderable evidence', the 'subtleties of glance, gesture and tone', will be missing. This idea is summed up in one of Wittgenstein's most striking aphorisms: 'If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Most of Lem's SF is about mankind encountering talking lions!<br/><br/>- Wittgenstein's very dry humor is amazing and noted in many episodes like this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Never having seen Wittgenstein before, he [Mabbott] assumed that this [Wittgenstein] was a student on vacation who did not know this hostel had been given over to those attending the conference. 'I'm afraid there is a gathering of philosophers going on here', he said kindly. Wittgenstein replied darkly: 'I too'.<br/></blockquote><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Instead of mingling with the mortals, their power is indirect; all those who do wrong are correctly identified and punished:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>No sooner had they blinded Euenius, however, than their livestock stopped giving birth and their soil turned similarly barren. When the Appollonians asked [the oracles] at Dodona and Delphi the reason for the calamity they were experiencing[, both gave the same answer]: that they had unjustly deprived Euenius, the guardian of the sacred flock, of his sight.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>The oracles are always right - except when they're bribed and then themselves duly punished - their prophecies always come true, often in ironic ways, as known from Oedipus.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>If you attack you will destroy a great empire.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Reading this is often like reading through an ancient Wikipedia, since Herodotus lists as many facts as he could collect. Like Wikipedia's links, every time Herodotus mentions a new place or a thing he can't help but immediately list everything about it, with the consequence that this reads like a phylogeny of stories, with branches branching off other branches, as if you'd replace all links in the Wikipedia by their respective articles' texts. You have to be careful when reading this, if you're tired when reading Herodotus' frequent sidetracking will confuse you.<br/><br/>Funny enough, it takes Herodotus about 6 or 7 of the 9 books until the ""action"" of the wars really starts; before that, he draws a picture of his world as complete and detailed as possible, knowing that this all will be lost and forgotten if not for his work. Book 2 is all about Egypt and what an amazing place it was, book 4 is about the Scythians and their customs. Darius, King of Persia and first enemy of Athens appears in book 3 - he dies in book 7, to be followed by Xerxes, who subsequently raises the biggest army the world had ever seen, literally drinking rivers dry, and their subsequent bloody run-in with the Spartans (here often Lacedaemonians, after the region of which Sparta was the capital) at Thermopylae under Leonidas (you know the comic and movie) and the subsequent defeat of the Persian fleet by the Greek fleet. <br/><br/>In between there are numerous speeches, fights, customs, small stories, rapes and brutal murders, intrigues, bribes, lootings, valorous acts in battle, stupid decisions, hilarious events, and philosophies.<br/><br/>Herodotus himself has a strong voice and judges the stories as told to him by others; sometimes highly skeptical, sometimes blindly trusting (in which case Holland's footnotes play the skeptic's part). By the way, the footnotes are numerous and extremely helpful in locating cross-references by Herodotus (or these cases where Herodotus says ""I'll talk about this later"" and then forgets all about it). In my ebook version with my font and size settings, the book ends at 68%, the rest is footnotes.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Everyone.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In that aspect, it's very much like Bell's Men Of Mathematics (<a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66358.Men_of_Mathematics"">GR link</a>, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1198713216?book_show_action=false"">my review</a>), not only is The Scientists structured similarly, the humorous tone and fun anecdotes are similar too:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Henry was painfully shy and hardly ever went out except to scientific gatherings - even at these, latecomers sometimes found him standing outside the door trying to pluck up enough courage to enter, long after he was a respected scientist in his own right. He communicated with his servants by writing them notes, wherever possible; and there are several stories about how on unexpectedly encountering a woman he did not know, he would shield his eyes with his hand and literally run away.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Since the author himself is a astrophysicist the focus is a bit more on physics, cosmology and astrophysics than on medicine or biology - two chapters are on biology (one on Lyell -> Darwin -> Wallace, one on Mendel -> many more I haven't heard of before (nice! Ever heard of Miescher?) -> Crick/Watson), only one part of a chapter is on medicine, one chapter on geology, the rest is physics (but that is a truth of the history of science - for a long time, Western scientists focused more on the stars and mechanics than on the human body).<br/><br/>Some more aspects I noted:<br/><br/>- Science shifted from a (often rich) gentleman's hobby to a full-time profession sometime around Darwin's life. I got nostalgic for a time where you could just work your whole life for a king without having to fill out grant applications every few years; but then again, you'd be dependent on the king's whims and mortality. Plus, with only a few outliers it was practically impossible for a ""poor"" person to even begin with scientific work.<br/><br/>- The descriptions of Galileo's and Bruno's troubles with the church are great - none of the usual ""martyrs for science!"" stuff, more (correct) focus on political and theological problems here. The history of scientists has, weirdly enough, quite a few <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianism"">arians</a> in it.<br/><br/>- Gribbin goes through great pain to make it clear that to become ""a name"" in the history of science, it's often not some mythological personal genius, but luck of being the right hard-working person at the right position at the right time. He often details the people who also made the important discovery at the same time as the ""famous"" discoverer made it, but for some reason, have been forgotten by history.<br/><br/>- Fallopian tubes are called ""tubes"" even though Fallopio originally described them as ""brass trumpets"", i.e., <i>tubas</i> - ""tubes"" is a mistranslation.<br/><br/>- Gribbin is no fan of Newton - although his discoveries were manifold and important, his rather extreme personality made work for other scientists very hard, and the cult of Newton's personality after Newton's death kept progress in some areas of science behind. Gribbin correctly points out that Newton didn't receive the knighthood for his scientific advances, but as ""a rather grubby bit of political opportunism by Halifax as part of his attempt to win the election of 1705"".<br/><br/>- Especially towards the end this book gets more dry, almost as if Gribbin had a deadline coming up and slogged through writing it<br/><br/>- Dalton discovered colour blindness, as he himself suffered from it. Imagine making that discovery!!<br/><br/>- Gribbin's not a big fan of Kuhnian scientific revolutions, as the structure and the afterword of this book make it clear. To him, scientific progress is developed ""essentially incremental, step-by-step"".<br/><br/>Recommended for: Scientists, people interested in history or the history of science",,,1,,,0,,,,,

According to him, Germany suffers from the rise of the ""mass-man"", the cog in the wheel without ""Selbstreflexion"", without care for his past or culture:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Mass-man moves, robotlike, from digestion to sleeping with his peroxide-blonde females, and produces children to keep the termite heap in continued operation. He repeats word for word the incantations of the Great Manitou, denounces or is denounced, dies or is made to die, and so goes on vegetating. And there is not even a blush when he is confronted by the legacy of his fathers, by the monuments of a noble past, by the crowning achievements of his own culture.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He hates Hitler and the NSDAP for their ""Prussianness"" (Reck styles himself as a anti-Prussian Bavarian, which still has the wonderful ""Saupreissn"", pig Prussians), their loud, blind and empty core, he hates the all-encompassing belief technology, he thinks that parliaments are chaotic and useless, he loves the Scholls - both for knowing how to live and knowing how to die - but he dislikes the soldiers around the Stauffenberg plot for doing too little too late, after the military itself allowed Hitler to rise to power.<br/><br/>The annotation in the NYRB edition does a good job of picking up when Reck repeats unsubstantiated rumors as facts, and the afterword on Reck's ""game of the self"" is splendid. However it doesn't translate (or even note) some peculiar German turns of the phrase like ""trained in Radau"", which doesn't mean a city but more ""trained in noisemaking"".<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in the Third Reich; people who're sick of reading ""the usual"" about this time and would like a unique perspective<br/><br/>P.S.: How can it be that I can easily buy the English translation of this in Australia, but there's simply no ebook in German?

Over a few years the reader follows the new settlers in the harsh conditions, as they try and make a living off the new land. All of them are trying to start a new life, but the harsh conditions take and take and rarely give. Bears, panthers, snakes and diseases attack the settlers and take their stock, yet the settlers carry on.<br/><br/>The narrator's language is direct, reminding me of Blood Meridian or Butcher's Crossing, often echoing the language of the book's inhabitants:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“There are no birds here,” she said. <br/>“Oh, yes,” he said, “the birds are here.” <br/>“I locked that door when I come in, and the smoke keeps birds out of the chimney.” <br/>“I feel their wings.

It begins with how to start your job-hunt, finding your strengths, updating your Linkedin (reasonable tips there!), and finding the job that suits you. Since programming interviews are often technical in nature, the majority of this book focuses on these parts. It goes over all the basic data-structures and gives you a couple of example problems from interviews for each structure. These are good in that the author goes through a ""natural"" thinking process with each problem - starting with the ""obvious"" and ""easy"" solution, showing where the caveats are, ""loudly"" thinking about possible ways to solve it, finding the ""good"" solution, and then sometimes going further to the ""perfect"" solution (which doesn't help in interviews, but is there for pure nerd-satisfaction). <br/><br/>After a problem was solved in ""plain text"", example programs are included. These are written in Java, C++ or C. A warning here: Many solutions include low-level concepts like pointers (or even pointers to pointers), so if you've only programmed in languages without ""manual pointers"" like Python or Ruby this book won't help you much. In fact, the String problems are a little bit frustrating to read when you know the solution in Python would be a (slow) one-liner like my_string.split("" "")[::-1] (that one's surprisingly complicated in C).<br/><br/>After going through all the basic data-structures like binary trees, stacks, heaps, strings etc. a couple of non-datastructure CS related things pop up, like graphics programming, concurrency, SQL etc., which I rarely see, but good to see them included here. Then there are a few chapters on the typical ""riddles"", like <a href=""http://www.coolmath4kids.com/math_puzzles/l1-threelights.html"">this one</a> (which doesn't even work with modern light-bulbs - LEDs don't get hot, fluorescent bulbs only a little), but the authors rightly state that these are cheap pot-shots which don't really help in anything. But since they come up in interviews, they had to be included. The book concludes with a couple of examples for ""knowledge""-based questions, and a helpful appendix on structuring/writing CVs.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Job-hunting programmers, or those in the last year of their studies. People who've never been to a technical programming interview and would like to know what to expect. People who like to solve programming riddles. People who need a crash-course/refresher on data-structures and algorithms.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Beginning programmers (too much low-level stuff). People who only program in high-level languages like Python or Ruby. People who want to study programming interview questions specifically - there are other, bigger, more complete books on that (but I don't really see the purpose behind that - in my own experience, people who learn programming solutions by heart [they exist!] can't program at all, which will hopefully become obvious in the interview).<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

She had an interesting style of invention - during her wartime work, necessity was the mother of invention (""we need these bombing tables and we need them yesterday"", so sub-routines were invented so several problems could be attacked at once), but after it, much of her work was inspired by making programming easier and more accessible - less formulas, more English, and a ton of teaching to get more people into programming. A very inspiring story. <br/><br/>There are other very interesting parts here - in describing Hopper's way of ""distributed invention"" I was often reminded of Raymond's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134825.The_Cathedral_the_Bazaar"">""The Cathedral and the Bazaar""</a>, her work was immediately shared with the community of programmers and mathematicians and their ideas were implemented (""Bazaar""-style invention, here called ""distributed invention"") which led to many improvements in A-1 and A-2. On the other hand, her work in the committee that designed COBOL was more of a ""Cathedral"" situation - a top-down committee of experts that first wrote the standard, then implemented the language.<br/><br/>Other parts reminded me of Brooks' <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month"">""The Mythical Man Month""</a> - some of their early day ""tricks"" with the Mark 1 computers (such as a library of subroutines so they'd have code that has been shown to work correctly, for example, the sin() function) is repeated as a tip in Brooks' book. And there's only about 40 years in between!<br/><br/>General Groves, who plays a relatively important part in Ray Monk's <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12041966-robert-oppenheimer"">biography of Oppenheimer</a> as Oppenheimer's ""military counterpart"" at the Manhattan Project, re-appears here as one of Hopper's bosses at Remington Rand. What a weird coincidence.<br/><br/>Of course, no history book wouldn't be without some ridiculously dry parts. This is definitely not ""pop"" history! I had to make more coffee when it came to the details of which committee did what and how their roles were defined, who sat at which position etc. during the creation of COBOL.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in the history of computing or computers<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who don't get a laugh out of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper#/media/File:H96566k.jpg"">this picture</a>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

To her, the Greeks were the first to bring ""light"" into the darkness of a world ruled by darkness and magic, in the form of rational thought. The Greeks were the first to play - she compares them to the Egyptians, to whom life was just suffering. Their statues, their architecture, their poetry and writing was reduced down to the barest possible; if you've said it as precise as possible, then that's enough, no need for repetition or fancy allusions. A few playwrights are given their own chapters, in which they are compared to their ""modern"" partner (if one exists). <br/><br/>To Hamilton, Greeks were the first and the last to be truly in love with knowledge and all possible viewpoints - she gives the example that there were plays making fun of their own side during the war, which received rave reviews and full theaters. Can you imagine the same thing happen in the US nowadays [1]? Of course, it feels like sometimes her image of Greece is <i>too positive</i>, and the darker times of Athens' hubris and fall are often quickly glossed over. Then again, why focus on the ugly when you're writing a love letter?<br/><br/>Recommended for those people who'd like to know why many still see Greek philosophy, thinking and art as important.<br/><br/>[1] Her example is from WW1.

While he's on the way to meet a former female colleague he realises that he has been more than blind towards her interest... It's hard to describe how well Ishiguro <i>understates</i> his reactions to her, and it's up to the reader to realise what's going on. It reminded me of (and if you're a man, it will remind you too) of dialogues in your youth like this one:<br/><br/>Her: Sooo (short pause, finger in hair and a twirl) what are you doing this weekend?<br/>You: Hmm not much.

Well, um, enjoy, I have to go now.<br/><br/>[exeunt you and your idiocy]<br/><br/>And then 10 years later this memory suddenly hits you out of nowhere and you <i>still</i> have to groan.<br/><br/>Anyway, the book is much more than that - there is some hilarity ensuing from too much Britishness (the 23-year old godson of the manor's lord is to marry soon - the father himself never explained ""the birds and the bees"", and is too shy to do it. He asks the godfather, who then turns out to be too shy, too, and the godfather asks the butler in a hilariously awkward scene, who does his best to try and bring up that particular topic of discussion), there is much about Britain's appeasement politics in the 20s and 30s, and you can't help but marvel how well this all is constructed.<br/><br/>The first quarter or so is dry (lots of ""philosophy of butlering"") but it sets up the character - so if you're finding yourself bored, keep on working, it will be worth it in the end.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's a long rambling hilarious yarn, there's no overbearing structure, it's just adventure (in the form of pirating and pillaging), followed by hanging around at home for a while, getting drunk and fighting, and then a bit more adventure (but no pillaging, only treasure hunting). I'd wager that on average, someone dies a violent but glorious death every three pages.<br/><br/>It's a world where death isn't particularly scary, as long as others got a good story out of it and you died fighting everything's going to be alright. For example, one guy with long beautiful hair tells the story of how his hair saved his life. He was captured by Norwegians (IIRC) who proceeded to cut off their prisoners heads, he asked whether someone could hold his hair while they cut off his head so it doesn't get soiled with blood, so a Norwegian agrees to hold up his hair. Before the axe comes down, the young man rips his head to the front so that the executioner cuts off the hands of the Norwegian. Now normally that would be an outrage but here, the Norwegians find that ""trick"" so funny, they set the young man free. Who cares if that guy bleeds to death from his stumps! It is a good death.<br/><br/>There's no overarching structure, Orm's encounters become unbelievable at some point (he just runs into old friends in the most faraway corners of the earth), except for Orm's wife Ylva women are mostly spoils of the war, and the second half of the book seriously loses in speed, but it's still a riveting read. It's a lighthearted version of Yoshikawa's Musashi.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fiction, historical fiction or fun in general",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Because that life was long and complicated the book is with 944 pages big enough to kill a cat, there's enough Japanese names to confuse any non-Japanese person (how many names are there? 500? Even the main guy's name changes three times!) and it's easily the most epic book I've read in the last 10 years (the Internet ruined the word ""epic"", by the way). <br/><br/>The book details the life of Hideyoshi from son of a poor country warrior, to wandering salesman, to personal page, to soldier, to leader of a regiment, to trusted retainer to finally leader of the entire clan. <br/><br/>There's a billion small stories about a country which attitudes are completely alien to me, one example is: Hideyoshi is laying siege to a castle, the enemy's leader doesn't want to give in, Hideyoshi doesn't want to lose thousands of soldiers in storming the castle, so he has a messenger approach the enemy general directly, asking him to commit suicide so that Hideyoshi can take the castle and everyone can safely go home. The general happily agrees (after all, his family and soldiers don't have to die, and he doesn't loose face), he commits ritual suicide on a boat in front of witnesses, everybody is happy and the campaign can continue. It's weird, but interesting.<br/><br/>The style may not be anyone's cup of tea, here's a pretty central paragraph:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>How boring would be a life lacking the confusions of many digressions or the difficult struggles! How soon would a man grow tired of living if he only walked peacefully along a level path. In the end, a man's life lies in a continuous series of hardships and struggles, and the pleasure of living is not in the short spaces of rest.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>As you can see, it's a very ""grandiose"" style, but one that I find makes it relatively easy to read, took me about 2 weeks to read the entire book. There are a couple of downsides - I don't think Hideyoshi makes a single mistake in the entire book, which I find hard to believe, and judging from the Wikipedia-article on him it looks like his life isn't that well documented that you can safely say ""these things actually happened"". He's got a couple of mistresses but that's all the ""bad"" there is to him, the rest of the story he's the most perfect human being imaginable, which makes it boring here and there. <br/><br/>One interesting side-effect is that you learn so much about warfare in Japan of the 15th and 16th century that the entire movie ""The Last Samurai"" is revealed as the complete bollocks that it is. <br/><br/>Recommended for:<br/>- fans of historical fiction or ancient Japan, Samurais cutting off each others' heads, Ninjas murdering people, people who like to read about ritual suicide every 50 pages or so, people who like to see long plans work out nicely<br/>- people who like to play Total War: Shogun <br/><br/>Not recommended for:<br/>- people who can't distinguish ""Nobuo"" from ""Nobutada"" or ""Nobunaga"" (these three are different, but related and quite important characters)<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Each chapter summarises the life of a mathematician (sometimes two, if their lives are intertwined), with about a quarter of each chapter being reserved for details on one or two discoveries.<br/><br/>In tone it reminded be a lot of Russell's History of Western Philosophy - there's the British humor and the strong opinions, some people may be put off by this. It's definitely no unbiased retelling of the history of mathematics (furthermore, about 80 years have passed. Many of these stories may turned out to have been falsehoods by now [and in looking up this book, many of them are, but that doesn't detract from their <i>fun</i>]).<br/>Some quotes to show the humor:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As a matter of temperament some find the Laplacian conception of an eternally stable solar system repeating the complicated cycle of its motions time after time for ever and ever as depressing as an endless nightmare. For these there is the recent comfort that the Sun will probably explode some day as a nova. Then stability will cease to trouble us, for we shall all quite suddenly become perfect gases.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Cauchy's life and character affect us like poor Don Quixote's — we sometimes do not know whether to laugh or to cry, and compromise by swearing.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But on the utterly imbecilic advice of his physician he began meddling in politics ""to benefit his nervous system."" If ever a more idiotic prescription was handed out by a doctor to a patient whose complaint he could not diagnose it has yet to be exhumed.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some things I learned:<br/><br/>- many famous mathematicians were ridiculous child prodigies in their youngest ages, Gauss being the most famous example, discovering formulas at the age of 9, finishing <i>Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</i> at the age of 21 (!!!) in Latin (!!!); William Rowan Hamilton spoke 13 languages by the time he was 13 years old (E. T. Bell gets very angry about this ""waste of time"", he could have been doing mathematics!). It may make you look at your own life with a <i>hint</i> of having already wasted it.<br/><br/>- others did terrible in traditional systems - like Poincaré, who nearly failed the mathematical parts of his Bachelor's degree and was only admitted because of his previous mathematical importance<br/><br/>- funding of science changed a lot with the French revolution - before that, good mathematicians got their money from benevolent rulers, after that, they either had to give lessons or were (sometimes poorly) employed by universities<br/><br/>- transfinite numbers are weird<br/><br/>- and much more, it's a long book<br/><br/>The biggest drawback, and here the book shows its age, is the <i>very</i> dry style of the mathematical parts, maybe I'm too spoiled by pop-science writing, maybe it's the age. Sometimes, the mathematics is rather simple and you wonder why the author takes so much time to expand on these points (the age?), sometimes it's so short that you have to go look it up on Wikipedia. These definitely take their time if you want to read them properly.<br/><br/>But then again, to quote the author (on a different occasion):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The choice of such phraseology is not merely stereotyped pedantry. There is a reason for its use, and careful writers mean exactly what they say when they assert that “we can find, etc” <i>They mean that they can do what they say</i>.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People into mathematics; people who think a book about mathematics is boring (you may want to skip or skim the mathematical parts, but it's your loss); fans of British humor<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People without patience, as it took me a few weeks to read this; People who need the truth and nothing but the boring truth",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He explains it for metabolic networks, for protein interaction networks, and more.<br/><br/>He uses the image of Borges' Library of Babel, except that each book is a station in the library of all possible connected protein interaction networks (most of them make no sense, some of them do), and these books are connected by single changes. Each reader is an individual of a population, and if you take the wrong step (mutation) and get a book without sense, you die.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that if you map these libraries for the organisms where there's data like <i>E. coli</i> or yeast, you can take random walks through there using programs. And what they found is that you can take very long walks (up to 80% of the library) through the library, ending up in very different networks that still produce the same outcome. That way, a large part of the library, and with that a large part of variation, is explored! Interestingly, you can do the same with human-created logical circuits, and you get very, very similar results. <br/><br/>For biologists reading this book especially the beginning might be slow as he uses many examples from undergrad biology like the lac-operon, Hox genes, and more. You might want to check out his publications instead: http://www.ieu.uzh.ch/wagner/publications.html<br/><br/>Especially ""140. Wagner, A.

"" looks good, Figure 13.2 is also in the book. Nice of him to provide reprints for most of his work!<br/><br/>Does this book solve the question of how nature comes up with innovations? It certainly is a great ""viewpoint"" and deserves more thought (from me, too).<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those interested in life who like to see things from a different angle.<br/><br/>P.S.: Looking around a bit for more reviews on the web, it seems there's a quite large group of people who are outraged by Wagner's few quips about creationists.

Some things that struck me particularly:<br/><br/>1. Since it's set in Victorian England, communication between towns and cities is very poor, especially in the beginning of the invasion, when the next village doesn't know that their neighbors are all dead. That made me think of what would happen today with instant communication around the world.<br/><br/>2. The protagonist is no hero, he's just there as a pure witness. Most current stories focus on the ""one hero who saves the day"", this protagonist is more a bit of a coward (he could have saved the annoying priest, for example).<br/><br/>3. The heatrays used by the aliens are invisible, something which a modern writer would never write! Modern SF requires rays to be visible, even if they can't be in reality. It just has been ingrained in our collective imagination. Other examples of this are gun-silencers that are completely silent, flashbangs that don't burn, sound in space, etc.<br/><br/>4. There are a few things illogical - the ending (or solution) is rather weird, and in its abruptness reminded me a lot of the ending of the movie Signs. <spoiler>You'd think they would have worn closed suits to survive earth's viruses - and how does human blood as their food work? You probably can't survive on alien meat, except if you share common ancestors, which is highly unlikely with Mars</spoiler> Furthermore, aliens seem to favor the UK for some reason (a tradition that has been happily continued in Dr. Who), but that could be just due to the little overview of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Anyway, nice proto-SF, good to see where the genre comes from.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Then there's the new 'Bazaar', in which rapid development around a core team of developers is favoured, developers who are constantly in contact with users and co-developers - most of open source software development happens like this.<br/><br/>It's an interesting time-document that directly led to the founding of what's now known as Mozilla, but it's also outdated. Reading the arguments I couldn't help but constantly think 'but what about Heartbleed?' for most points - for those few who haven't heard of it, Heartbleed is/was a huge security bug in the widely used openSSL library that enabled attackers to read arbitrary memory of any SSL-enabled webserver.<br/><br/>Especially towards the end the book builds up a few straw-men to take down, and then it gets annoying - like when the book says that 'Bazaar' style development doesn't need the business (Cathedral) world's top-down style management, because open source is just so much <i>fun</i> that it doesn't need managers! 'But what about heartbleed?': the OpenSSL code is such a notorious mess that for years developers who wanted to fix any problems recoiled as if encountering a Lovecraftian horror, quickly abandoning their good intentions to save their sanity. The argument of 'many shallow eyes see all important bugs' obviously didn't pan out, the bug existed for years.<br/><br/>Only now are some openBSD people working on fixing OpenSSL in LibreSSL, but for them it's a concerted effort with 'management' involved, so it seems to be some kind of chimera between Bazaar and Cathedral, in which only very few 'outsiders' are involved.<br/><br/>I guess Bazaar style development doesn't work that well for security relevant software; it's insanely complicated and there are too many 'bad' agents (like the NSA) who can act as good 'customers of the Bazaar'. <br/><br/>But it still goes some good points here and there, like for example this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's a quick read, I'd recommend it to all open source programmers interested into seeing where their hobby comes from.<br/><br/>UPDATE 30.12.2014: I just found <a href=""http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257&ref=fullrss"">this longer good essay</a> revisiting the main points of the book, quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>That is the sorry reality of the bazaar Raymond praised in his book: a pile of old festering hacks, endlessly copied and pasted by a clueless generation of IT ""professionals"" who wouldn't recognize sound IT architecture if you hit them over the head with it. It is hard to believe today, but under this embarrassing mess lies the ruins of the beautiful cathedral of Unix, deservedly famous for its simplicity of design, its economy of features, and its elegance of execution.

It's revealed that these men have huge armies, but it's quickly established that these armies rarely fight - so what's the point in having 99% of mankind keep on producing robots?).<br/><br/>The premise is a bit too black/white for me, too obvious criticisms of a media society, and the story just drags along until it suddenly ends out of the blue without any real solution, as if Dick hit some deadline and just abandoned the story there.

This ""dystopian future without morals or structure but with lots of blood"" seems to have been a big thing in the 90s: see Judge Dredd, RoboCop, Rogue Trooper, (in fact, most of the 2000 AD characters), it's also an aspect in some older Gibson books.<br/><br/>Womack's Dryco novels (and his I think unrelated but IMHO best ""Random Acts Of Senseless Violence"") are set in a very similar world - it's America of the not-so-distant future, society kind of works but has mostly collapsed, mega-corporations run the place more than politicians, and due to various reasons the law isn't exactly enforced, i.e., most of the characters are under threat of death and constantly kill themselves, without anybody blinking an eye. On most pages random bystanders die.<br/><br/>The first one, Ambient, was a bit too much over the top for me (for example, ""board room meetings"" are matches to the death by a companies' champion against the other companies' champions, and the losing company has its CEO's head cut off while the companies' ownership is being transferred to the winner). This third one, Hearthen, is a bit less extreme because it acts as a bit of a prequel - it's set before Dryco became the company running the USA, with some events of the first book (such as the AI, or Ambient's ""big bad guy"") being nicely foreshadowed. Therefore, most events described aren't that extreme as in the first one (but the great Ambients don't feature as much as in the first one).<br/><br/>The basic story is that Dryco is looking for a messiah so it can use him for their company PR, finds one who performs Jesus-like miracles and tries to hire him, he mostly goes along with it (without any real motivation except ""my God(s) told me to""), there's a relatively believable ""good"" female main character, yet the story often just bungles around without really progressing. I guess it's good as a part of the series but doesn't work on its own, yet I liked the ""less extreme""/""more quiet"" aspects of it.<br/><br/>[1] IT HAD A TURBO BUTTON to slow down to 16 Mhz (else Theme Park would run too fast)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Ford",,"=""""","=""""",4,3.95,Princeton University Press,Kindle Edition,269,2012,2012,2014/11/17,2014/04/06,biology,biology (#10),read,"A very interesting take on agriculture with a focus on plants and their future - the author applies Dawkin's selfish gene concept to explain and hypothesize about various concepts floating around agriculture right now. <br/>He's got three basic ideas on which the book is based on - the first is that natural selection doesn't miss easy ror tradeoff-free improvements; in these chapters there's disappointment in the promises of GM-advocates, as the ""low hanging fruits"" of plant improvement may not exist. I don't fully agree with this - after all, evolution hasn't stopped and given us perfect species, and without the fitting natural selection, the low hanging fruit may still be there - but I can see what he means. <br/><br/>The second point is that competitive success is better than success by persisting - for example,  forests or ecosystems usually don't compete against each other, so there is no telling whether their actual composition is ""ideal"" or not - maybe yes, maybe no, the point is that the blind copying of this abundance can either help or hurt, we have no clue as to what outside pressures these compositions developed. Just because they have persisted doesn't mean that should blindly copy them.<br/><br/>In these chapters are the best (and most science-fiction-ish) ideas - for example, wheat grows larger because of inter-individual competition for light, which isn't good for us humans since then yield is lower, the plant has to put resources into growing instead of into our food. Borlaug reversed this process by introducing dwarf wheat with a much higher yield. Denison propose that we create plants that actually cooperate each other, for example, by making sure that plants in the vicinity get enough light, while the plants grow in such a way that harmful weeds are shaded. Quite outlandish, but doable! There's also a very interesting discussion on assisting plants in selecting for ""helpful"" rhizobia in varying nodules.<br/><br/>Right now our only successes in plant modification is that they express toxins, which is relatively easy, it's just a single gene that isn't particularly part of any system. If you start to modify salinity resistance, for example, the image gets bleaker - we've had some success by introducing ion pumps from salinity-resistant species, but these systems are still too unknown to drastically improve yield. Changing species so that they cooperate, that's still far, far away.<br/><br/>The third point is a relatively obvious one - we should always hedge bets and not bet on just one approach, this chapter is a bit more political as it includes various taxing schemes (an interesting Nitrogen-tax is proposed where farmers pay per kg of Nitrogen used, but get a tax bonus for every kg that is actually used - for example, 1000kg of wheat use 23kg of Nitrogen, so these 23kg would receive a bonus).<br/><br/>I don't always agree with his ideas, for example, he's a bit disappointed that so much money is being poured into the various -omics approaches while the ""classic"" fields of ecology and agronomy are being underfunded, he's disappointed that so many people work with <i>Arabidopsis</i> while there are so many alternative plants to work at, but I think that the omics stuff is still so early, and we still know so little about other, more complicated plants that it makes sense to keep on working with the relatively simple <i>Arabidopsis</i>.. For now. Some people try to model the human brain, but more people are working on the simple <i>C. elegans</i> with its exactly 302 neurons. <br/><br/>Bonus quote:<br/><blockquote><br/>Do legumes, like the farm-owners in The Grapes of Wrath, advertise more openings than actually exist, to attract a surplus of applicants?<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Plant biologists, breeders, interested laymen, people interested in the future of agriculture, people interested in the big picture",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Transcripts of recordings of a few lectures on English literature Borges gave in the 1960s in Buenos Aires, before he was internationally famous, which is why the recordings of these lectures don't exist anymore.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it's very conversational in tone, there's very little university related talking going on (of course, there is a possibility that the editors cut this) - Borges talks only once about tests, never again about anything but Anglo-Saxon/English literature; he seems to be more concerned about recommending books students should read instead of drilling tidbits of knowledge into them for tests. That's another amazing thing about these lectures; Borges was already mostly blind, everything he quotes (for some reason in Spanish) is from memory, all years and all facts are from his head, which is why he so often gets students to read longer poems to the class for him.<br/><br/>But, if you're looking for Borges as a builder of mysterious worlds, you won't find him here; these are introductory lectures, there's very little interpretation, more often than not Borges is more concerned with how fun the story is and how beautiful the language sounds than he bothers with explaining, as an example, the political background of why a certain writer wrote this poem. <br/><br/>Sometimes it's strange in that he gets a student to read a poem in English, then summarizes the story in the middle of the poem (remember, the students are young and probably didn't know much English yet), then lets the student read the rest of the poem, and at that point you would have expected Borges to talk some more about what they just read, focus on single elements and interpret them, but he just has the student read the next poem. Another curious thing is the choice of authors by Borges - there's only a single page on Shakespeare, but an entire lecture on Stevenson.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who are looking for an introduction to English literature, or those who need more books on their to-read shelf<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want to see a blind man construct a library containing every possible book",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There's a woman trying to understand a conspiracy that may not exist in the first place. <br/><br/>There are jokes about the long development time of Daikatana, nitpicky dialogues about random vs. pseudo-random numbers, Ghost In The Shell quotes, murders, a strip-club called ""Joie de Beavre"", a professional Nose (i.e., a private investigator who works only with smells), and of course, nothing is ever really resolved, and paranoia is the basic form of consciousness. <br/><br/>Impressive that Pynchon, who certainly doesn't count as a ""digital native"" - at the time of Bleeding Edge's writing, he was about 75 years old - is the first one who can actually write a good novel about the Internet. Neuromancer hasn't aged well, Ready Player One is more concerned with cramming 80s references, some pretend to be about the Internet but are actually about the thing you watched when Angelina Jolie logged into a server in the movie Hackers (like Mankell's Firewall). When Pynchon mentions Back Orifice and Netbus I get nostalgic for my script kiddie days.<br/><br/>Of course not all references make sense, for example, the Daikatana joke - the game actually was released about a year before the novel takes place. But then again, who wants to know?<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of fun, the Internet, post-modern books making fun of post-modern books. Fans of The Crying Of Lot 49, I feel like both books are a bit more ""Pynchon light"", i.e., they are easier to follow.<br/> <br/>Not recommended for: People who need a clean, straight-cut story with all of their story-lines resolved.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

In Germany, up until his death last year he was <i>the</i> guy for ""German high culture"" - if there was a controversial new German book, at least one TV-station would interview him. The biggest newspapers put him on the cover when he wrote a more important critique (most famously, this cover: <br/><br/><img src=""http://www.zensur-archiv.de/images/7/71/Spiegel34.jpg""><br/><br/>). With a few others he had a huge weekly TV show in which they argued about new and old books. Like all Germans, I grew up with the guy, at my parents' place there's two of the book collections he put out, each collection a case of about 20 big books with the (to Reich-Ranicki) most important German literature. In 1999 he published his autobiography, and it's great!<br/><br/>From now on spoilers.<br/><br/>Roughly split into two parts, the first one being Marcel Reich-Ranicki's youth in Poland and Berlin, then his internment in the Jewish ghetto in Warschau, how he lost his entire family to Treblinka, married his wife in the ghetto (the story of how he met her - wow) how he escaped with tons of luck, was hidden by a Polish worker, until the Soviet army invaded Poland in 1944 and he was free.<br/><br/>The second part of the book is his short work for the Polish government as a kind of Till Eulenspiegel spy who doesn't know anything about his work and receives no orders, then his disenchantment with Communist Poland, his move to Germany and his rise to become the biggest critic of German literature, publishing articles weekly, being in constant contact with all famous writers of Germany after 1945. He never even went to university, apart from high school, he was completely self-taught. Amazing.<br/><br/>The first part should interest everyone, the detached way he writes about the loss of so many people close to him kills you. The second part is probably only of interest to Germans, or those who are into modern German literature. People like Günter Grass, Anna Seghers (great story about Reich-Ranicki realizing that she didn't understand her own work), Wolfgang Koeppen, Golo Mann, Stefan Fest and more make up the bulk of this part (how cool was Wolfgang Koeppen?), and if these names don't tell you anything, then the second part will bore you.<br/><br/>There is however a great, short anecdote in that part in which Joachim Fest invited Albert Speer (""Hitler's architect"" and close associate, free after 15 years of prison) and Reich-Ranicki to the same book release and it's a small miracle Reich-Ranicki didn't murder Speer on the spot. I might have.<br/><br/>Throughout both parts the love for literature and music abounds, full of quotes, so this book is a treat for fans of literature. I read through the 500+ pages in one or two days. Last month a new collection of older essays on German literature was published in Germany, can't wait to read it.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: If you're not into books, you'll probably be bored. But what are you doing on Goodreads then?",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The book is best in Simonini's ethical gymnastics (as in, 'I don't forge documents, I create documents that should have existed in the first place') and various murderous shenanigans.<br/><br/>The rather convoluted structure of the novel, with one narrator summarizing a diary held jointly by the master forger Simonini and a priest who may or may not be Simonini, didn't add anything to the novel at all (to me).<br/><br/>Still worlds better than <i>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana</i>.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of historical fiction, Eco is still the best at that.<br/>Not recommended for: People with zero knowledge of European history, I guess it'll get confusing fast.<br/><br/>P.S.: You have to choose where you read this, I'm pretty sure it's weird when your seat neighbour on the bus reads pagelong rants about how the Jews are behind everything",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The Outsider is alone. Wilson describes the definition and the problems of the Outsider by using literature (particularly Hesse, and a great re-interpretation of Dostoevsky's lifework) and the lives of a few Outsiders like T.E. Lawrence, van Gogh and the ballet dancer Nijinsky. To Wilson, all of these men failed at their task of 'solving' the problems of the outsider. Some committed 'mind-suicide' by turning away from these questions, some like Hesse died before they could finish their path, others like Nietzsche or Nijinsky went crazy [1], others like van Gogh killed themselves. You see, it's not an easy path.<br/><br/>The book is about 60 years old, but its main questions are still valid and as unsolved as they were back then. It seems the work on these questions died together with the counter-culture of the 70s. A few contemporary writers (such as Bret Easton Ellis or Tao Lin) touch on the themes of the Outsider's alienation, but then immediately coil back and devolve into a numbing: mindless sex, drugs, etc.<br/><br/>If you've felt yourself as an 'Outsider', then this book is for you. Wilson published it when he was just 24 [2], I believe people older than that could not have written a similar book. Maybe I just found my niche in society and stopped thinking so much about the absurdity of it all? Have I, like T. E. Lawrence, committed mind-suicide?<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of his path towards a solution of these problems, which he apparently developed more in subsequent books; it's too much religion, too much mysticism for me (for example: is there a realization of the self, or is it just self-deceit, a replacement for a purpose in life? I don't even think the 'self' exists, something which Wilson sometimes touches on ['we are a collection of Is'], but then immediately goes back to assuming that the 'self' is a thing, and therefore, a 'higher' level of life is possible. I'm not really convinced that is possible in the first place.).<br/><br/>Anyway, these problems still exist, they haven't magically dissolved in clouds of logic. It's a shame that we as a society have just covered the Outsider's problems in layers of irony to pretend they don't exist (in that point, David Foster Wallace was absolutely right).<br/><br/>[1] There's an interesting anecdote in the book - when Nijinsky went crazy, he stood in the middle of the street with a cross, asking people if they had found Jesus - a man informed his wife, he had witnessed Nietzsche doing exactly the same thing 10 years before, when Nietzsche went crazy.<br/>[2] Impressive how many books, writers, ideas he cites; and for how many writers he has strong opinions (Dostoevsky, for example, is a 'shoddy craftsman'). I'm now 4 years older and I haven't even read half of these books.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

My job was to stand next to a machine which filled plastic bags with cheap, mixed white wine, and a conveyor belt put these bags into boxes. Australians call these bags affectionately ""goon bags"". My task was to put the filled boxes on pallets.<br/> <br/>I worked with a man about 30 years my senior - he had worked in that factory for more than 20 years, the last 10 years on that machine. With my 19 years, in a state that constantly seeks the new, that man was my nightmare personified, and I could not understand how he could stand this life. <br/>My perception of his life as a nightmare wasn't improved by the fact that his first action, every morning, was to take the first filled goon bag. He drank one bag per shift. I once asked him half-jokingly what his future plans were - he answered: ""I have only 15 years to go, then I can retire!"" That answer gave me a minor panic attack. <br/><br/>I soon lived in his world: I don't know if you've ever worked in a factory, but once you're fully in a mindless repetitive task, time ceases to exist. After 2 weeks of work, 8 hour shifts were over in seconds, and at home I was too tired to stop the flow of seconds. A month of this work felt like 3 minutes, and I could understand how the man could treat 15 years so flippantly; to him, 15 years are half an hour.<br/><br/>This book transported me right back into that mindset: ""I still have time"", the lie based on the vague hope that something might happen to you, while the days are just slipping away. The K.-like passivity I so easily fall into, based on the lie that things happen to me, I don't have to make them happen. This book gave me a minor panic attack.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who think there's still time, this book is a warning.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The original title, which roughly translates to ""The age of the Asakusa gamblers"", fits best (and in this case, the word for gamblers is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakuto"">Bakuto</a>). The main character of the book <i>is</i> a Yakuza, but not the kind you associate with it today - their only trade is illegal gambling, the kind of gambling you might know from Samurai period movies. You know: three guys sitting at a table, the guy in the middle half-naked who's job it is to throw the dice, everybody shouting 'Odds!' or 'Even!' to bet on the outcome, the other two guys collecting or handing out money, that's it.<br/><br/>There are a couple of wonderful scenes - for example, at one point the Yakuza are told by the police to hand in all of their guns or they would be shut down. Since guns were practically impossible to get, they didn't have any, but in order to escape persecution they had to move heaven and earth to find some. In the end, they bought three guns, each at the price of a <i>house</i>, so they could hand those in to the police.<br/><br/>It's not particularly well-written (translated?), and the story stays a bit unfocused, but it's quite interesting.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

And it's not like he's evading the war - if he doesn't lie in his recollections, then he's at the forefront of every battle, always overtaking his own people. He makes Die Hard movies look plausible.<br/><br/>Two really weird aspects about the book:<br/><br/>1) He is a huge fan of wartime heroism - he doesn't care for why or what he fights, as long as he can prove his ""Ritterlichkeit"", his chivalry. If he dies, so be it; it would be an honour to die on the battle-field (one is reminded of Mishima). In fact lots of people in this book die for absolutely nothing (one example are his ""boys"", the lower ranks who have to do his minor tasks for him - several of them die getting his food).<br/><br/>2) (This one might be lost in translation if you don't read the German original) He often uses the language of sports to describe the war, which feels rather strange when he talks about his friends being blown up in the words that I know only from tennis. Storming the enemy's trenches is a ""short, sports-like sensation"" - injured soldiers are ""ausgeschieden"" (eliminated? but that word is used in death,too) , which nowadays is only used for sportsmen who're forced to leave the competition due to external circumstances  - he's injured during a huge battle, yet he's sad about leaving the battlefield in this ""interesting moment"". <br/><br/>Maybe this is a product from the fact that he doesn't shy back from his own monstrosity - there are several scenes in the book in which he's just a twitch away from executing unarmed enemies; he often shoots fleeing soldiers in the back. A modern Iraq veteran writing about his war like this would be branded a psychopath (yet he might not be lying).<br/><br/>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_J%C3%BCnger"">Jünger Wikipedia article</a> makes for good reading, too - he was against National Socialism to the point that he had connections to the Stauffenberg bomb plot. Only his famous <i>In Stahlgewittern</i> and his extremely high-level merits saved him from being executed. Interestingly, he later experimented with many drugs and became a good friend of Albert Hofmann, the discoverer of LSD. It's the last thing I expected from a far-right conservative war hero.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>Those interested in history or war, this year's centennial is a good chance to read this.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: The squeamish, there's blood, brains and severed body pieces on practically every page.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The various facts about different ant colonies are quite inspiring, though.<br/><br/>One note: It's often said that Wilson doesn't like maths and tells other people they don't need it, but here the position is a bit better fleshed out, and more agreeable: <br/>1) he only talks about algebra as used for model building and in theoretical biology, he never mentions statistics at all (which you'll need, dear student).<br/>2) he correctly says that the time investment into learning all the maths is better invested elsewhere if you got diverging interests - you can always find a collaborator who's better at mathematics than you are. The last two chapters, in which Wilson describes how theories are developed and tested using stories from his life, show that; he always lists collaborators who built the models based on his data.<br/>In the end, it seems he says 'you don't need maths' as a bit of 'propaganda', since there are prospective scientists who end up in different careers out of a fear of mathematics.<br/><br/>Recommended for: High school students/undergrads who are looking for something to do with their lives",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Without his stupid and unnecessary lies in the 50s, the entire FBI communist scare theatre in which  he lost his security clearance wouldn't have happened this way. His earlier physics papers had quite a few mathematical errors, but he did predict the existence of positrons and of black holes.<br/><br/>This book is full of small, beautiful details and inspiring stories, too many to quote here.

When describing the development of physical theories, Monk has a habit of jumping into the future, as in: 'The first clue towards this new particle was #{something} (20 years later, it was revealed that this particle was actually two particles). The second clue was #{something else}.' It's a bit like Holmes describing the first clue, then revealing who the murder was, and then revealing the second clue.<br/><br/>P.S.: Who knew that after relativity, Einstein's contributions to physics were less than minor for more than 30 years?<br/><br/>P.P.S.: Two quotes of Oppenheimer that are very important today.<br/><br/>On secrecy around the atomic bombs:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>There is grave danger for us that these decisions have been taken on the basis of facts held secret. This is not because the men who must contribute to the decisions, or must make them, are lacking in wisdom; it is because wisdom itself cannot flourish, nor even truth be determined, without the give and take of debate and criticism. The relevant facts could be of little use to an enemy,yet they are indispensable for an understanding of questions of policy.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>On knowing yourself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>It is the knowledge of the inwardness of evil, and an awareness that in our dealings with this we are very close to the center of life. It is true of us as a people that we tend to see all devils as foreigners,; it is true of us ourselves, most of us, who are not artists, that in our public life, and to a distressing extent our private life as well, we reflect and project and externalize what we cannot bear to see within us. When we are blind to the evil in ourselves, we dehumanize ourselves, and we deprive ourselves not only of our own destiny, but of any possibility of dealing with the evil in others.<br/></blockquote>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The authors go to lengths to put every stage in Darwin's life in the context of the bigger social movements surrounding Darwin.<br/><br/>Some other things I learned:<br/><br/>- If you've got an earth-shattering theory, make sure that everybody respects you based on other work first; Darwin published a geological book on coral reefs, and then worked for 5 years on barnacles. You'll also need influential friends who will publicly support your theories, and fight for them.<br/><br/>- Similar to Galileo in Feyerabend's Against Method, the war around Natural Selection wasn't won using science, but propaganda. Darwin had many scientific friends who fought his public wars for him, Thomas Huxley being at the front. I have to read a biography on Huxley, ""Darwin's bulldog"", next - luckily Adrian Desmond wrote on, too.<br/><br/>- Ideas never stand alone in a vacuum. I knew before this book that Darwin's theories on natural selection are based on the already known concept of evolution, on Malthus and Lyell. This book does a great job of exhibiting all minor and major influences on Darwin's thinking.<br/><br/>- Something I heard for the first time in this book is how precarious Darwin's health was. Psychosomatic? Crohn's disease? The book never explains it, but after every minor period of stress, Darwin either vomited or had to retreat to his bed for a week. He rarely held public speeches, preferring letters. Bad reviews could send him to bed for weeks. (On writing this I checked Google - <a href=""http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/61/1/23.full"">at least one publication says he had Crohn's disease</a>)<br/><br/>- Back then, people had their children late in life - I remember at least one couple in the book where the mother gives birth to her first child at 38. Darwin's wife Emma gave birth to their last, tenth child at the age of 48. People say that ""older"" mothers are a recent trend, doesn't seem to be the case?<br/><br/>- Darwin pioneered a few approaches for which we have fancy buzzwords now. He tracked most of the things he did, including all scores of all Backgammon games against his wife, his health - we call that Quantified Self now. On scientific questions, he tracked and kept all minor details about his work - sending out questionnaires to all parties that could possibly have anything to do with the question, which before him wasn't that common.<br/><br/>- Science 150 years ago had a completely different model of funding. Darwin himself was mostly funded by his father, the Voyage of the Beagle was completely paid for by Dr. Darwin. Later on, Darwin's money came from farms his father bought him, living the Dickensian dream. At the beginning of Darwin's career, science was mostly done by ""unemployed gentlemen scholars"" (of which there is <a href=""http://robertedgar.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/an-unemployed-gentleman-scholar/"">nowadays only one</a>), but the employment model changed during his life towards what we have now, mostly government-funded.<br/><br/>- Since the majority of this book is based on letters, I wonder how biographies of the future will work. Nowadays it's all emails, most of them in password-protected data vaults that will disappear when the hosting company (inevitably) disappears. I'd like to read scientific journals of historians a hundred years in the future - with publications such as ""How to restore e-mails from the early 21st century email client, Mozilla Thunderbird"".<br/><br/>- Like many successful people, Darwin (for the longest time) didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He had a Pokemon-like obsession with collecting bugs, the Voyage of the Beagle only happened because of luck. Reassuring if you're, like me, one of those people who for the longest time just drifted along in life.<br/><br/>- Huxley coined ""agnostic"" when he got annoyed that opponents of natural selection always tried to drag the debate onto religious grounds. Haeckel (nowadays mostly known for his beautiful naturalistic paintings) coined many terms we use today in biology - ""phylum"", ""phylogeny"", and many more. The story of Haeckel, with his broken English, meeting Darwin, with his barely existing German, is one of the cutest stories in the book.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who want their history cut-and-dry; this book belongs to narrative history, often describing things which the author could have no way of knowing.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like to trace the development of ideas. Fans of the history of biology. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Starting around 1890 and ending in 1939, this is something of a memoir of Stefan Zweig, one of the most famous German-language Austrian writers of the early 20th century. But it's less about Zweig himself than about the <i>artistic world</i> of Vienna and Paris before the first world war. Both had a brimming high culture that, if Zweig doesn't call on too much hyperbole, I haven't encountered once in my life. Both cultures never seem to have recovered from both world wars - I've been to Vienna and was greeted by arrogance; I've been to Paris and was greeted by the smell of asparagus (rs4481887 (A;A) says hello). Maybe it takes a few hundred years more?<br/><br/>Several times the book surprised me - did you know that before 1914, you didn't need a passport for anything? Zweig travelled to the US and to India without one; and, to kill some time, found 5 different jobs open to anyone; no-one had visa or passports back then, it wasn't needed. I also didn't know that Austrian women around 1900 lived extremely strict lives; no woman was allowed to know about her sexuality, it was the husband's job during the wedding night to, um, give a crash-course. (Interesting sidenote: Zweig firmly believed that prostitution went down after these strict rules disappeared. I'm skeptical.)<br/><br/>I was also surprised to learn in what an environment Zweig grew up in: his circle of adolescent friends all started to publish in literary magazines around 17, 18 years old - all of them constantly writing and bouncing ideas off each other, meeting with such famous writers as Hoffmansthal and more. In fact it's amazing what famous names show up in this book, many names of the greatest artists appear. Some of those were Zweig's friends, some of them colleagues, all of them described in several scenes: Theodor Herzl, Rudolf Steiner, Romain Rolland (he was of particular importance to Zweig and appears often), Rilke (especially fun descriptions of him - somehow comically inept at life), Yeats, Gorky, Walter Rathenau (!!), Karl Haushofer, Emile Verhaeren, Ignaz Seipel, James Joyce, H.G. Wells, and many many more.<br/><br/>Surprising too that Zweig, after he enrolled in university, immediately took three years off. You can't do that anymore - universities have lost their role of creating ""citizens"", now universities are concerned with churning out <i>Humankapital</i> in the duty of neoliberalism and capitalism (I'm just jealous). It's also fun to know that the <i>Burschenschaften</i> and <i>Verbindungen</i> back then were the same idiotic far-right weirdos they are now (except that nowadays, most of them stopped fencing with ""real"" weapons - the visible facial scar has disappeared from Germany's intelligentsia).<br/><br/>Zweig saw himself as a citizen of the world first, and much of this book is concerned with the European project and the slow death of the ""Weltgewissen"" (the world's conscience). The parts in which both world wars start are heart-breaking, and the strongest of the book; Zweig sees the suffering, and suffers himself. He knew that we as human can only get past the violence if we unite. Maybe now my generation has a chance again - humans from all countries are connected to each other, in fact, I'd wager that most of my friends grew up in the Internet first and in their country second.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who see themselves as citizens of the world. European politicians. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It was like this:<br/><br/>here are some numbers, put them into the formula for the t-test, when the number that comes out is below 0.05 write ""I reject the Null Hypothesis with a p-value of X"". I never really learned about the basic assumptions behind this test (and all the other ones), nor did I learn about how to interpret and actually <i>think</i> about these results. Did I make mistakes in my analysis? What are possible mistakes? What could I do better? <i>What did I actually do there?</i><br/><br/>Here's a great book for exactly that set of problems - it starts off with an introduction and explanation of all the basic words and teachings of statistics (p-values, cutoffs, etc.), then goes to the basic tests (t-test, non-parametric tests, ANOVA etc.).. each method isn't introduced from the math angle, in fact the book has maybe 5 to 10 formulas, but lists the basic assumptions of the method and what you can glance from the results.<br/><br/>One caveat: Like most statisticians, Motulsky has opinions: 95% CIs are more intuitive to understand than t-tests, basing analyses on smoothed data is crap, etc. Might not be everyone's cup of tea. Motulsky also the author of the GraphPrism software for statistical analysis so that one's frequently featured (example: ""I made this analysis using Graphpad."").

He usually starts off with a mini-biography of the essay's namesake, only then to go wherever the links take him - reading these essays feels like talking to someone who's in love with his work. 'This guy wrote some of the greatest essays ever, oh by the way if you like him there's this half-forgotten contemporary artist whose arias you should listen to, did I tell you I once met his cousin and we had the most wonderful discussion of Aristotle?' - this breathless love is how most of the essays are structured.<br/><br/>The essays are ordered alphabetically, James writes that this order is arbitrary, yet I can't help but think that it's no coincidence that the book ends with the essay on Stefan Zweig. The Austrian <i>Kaffeehaus</i>-culture of liberal humanism under the roof of the arts is one of the major themes of all essays. The destruction of the Austrian culture by the Austria's <i>Anschluß</i> (the word Anschluß appears at least 50 times) and the scattering of Paris' intellectuals during the German invasion, is heavily implied to be the worst thing to have happened to the European intellectual life in the last 100 years, and most of the essays focus on that particular group of people. It's a joy to read his takedown of Sartre, and his love for such greats as Polar, Camus, Chamfort, Croce, Kafka, Friedell,  Reich-Ranicki (as a German, that made me happy) is gigantic and jumps off the pages, infecting you. I've underlined so many books, it's going to be a minor chore to add them to my to-read shelf.<br/><br/>Luckily, James is also a funny writer:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Lysenko preached the kind of biological theories that Stalin could understand: i.e., they were poppycock.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Some of the essays are rather strange, in these, James just goes off the track too far. The essay on Sophie Scholl quickly morphs into one about Natalie Portman (and Portman gets way more pages, weirdly enough), the essay on Charlie Chaplin immediately turns into a lacklustre discussion of art vs. science (and I've read better things about that particular 'conflict'), one essay is a bit about how the 'degeneration' of English is bad: as a biologist, I firmly believe that people who hold beliefs like that would have stood on shore while the first reptile crawled on land, telling the reptile to 'stop degenerating'. The essay on Heinrich Heine is just an overlong negative rant about autograph seekers.<br/><br/>The worst essay is also the most Australian one, in which he rants for pages on pages on how the Afghani asylum seekers on board the Tampa bound to Australia in 2001 are just 'illegal immigrants' and 'queue jumpers', who should have just stayed in their home country until their application would have been accepted. It's especially worse because James, at that point, has spent 400 pages being in love with WW2-era intellectuals who've done nothing but 'jump queues' when they've escaped their home-country - can you imagine Einstein just sitting in Germany while the Gestapo is kicking down doors, waiting for his letter of invitation? Thomas Mann, too, was allowed into the USA without any papers, and Czechoslovakia even offered him citizenship so that he could formally immigrate.<br/><br/>Sometimes, his own character comes through too much, I think this is best exemplified by this sentence:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>When filming in Rome, I had a jacket made by the celebrated tailor Littrico, and found out that I had the same measurements as Gorbachev: they were on file in Littrico's office.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>To which I can only say: so what?<br/><br/>But these <i>Rohrkrepierer</i>-essays are in the tiny minority. I'd love to see a book like this on the life and work of scientists (if I remember correctly, only one of the 'good' essays has to do with science).<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who can't get enough stuff into their brain.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who, if they go on travelling to a beautiful country, get angry if there's a detour.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

If I ever wind up teaching at a university (stranger things have happened) I will be ""borrowring"" from the appendix of this book with useful templates for feedback etc., and I will have to re-read the entire book, again. It's not that long anyway.<br/><br/>Reading through the chapters I couldn't help but be reminded of my terrible high school years and how the teachers seemed to have actively tried to do everything wrong, with no feedback, one big evaluation at the end of the year instead of small ones, terrible classroom atmosphere, no defined goal of learning, no rubrics, and on and on and on.<br/><br/>I would love to read the same book, but with a different target audience - a book that takes all this peer-reviewed, published and established knowledge about learning and bundles it into a manual on how to learn and study ""the best"" way(s). It would have helped tremendeously in my high school and university years.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Those who teach, and those who like to learn by themselves and would like to learn more efficiently.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The book summarizes the beginnings of genetics in the fruitfly, and describes the beginnings of research into the genetic bases for the feeling of time, of sexuality, and for memory in fruitflies. <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Like Bastian</a> I didn't know anything about Benzer before, so that was an eye-opening experience - and it's cool to read about how all the 'big names' like Watson, Feynman etc. fit into the history of genetics.<br/><br/>Sometimes, the author looses a bit of control over his metaphors and, in my opinion, makes the gene -> phenotype connection too simplistic. All direct quotations of Benzer do it 'right' (if there is such a thing) - Benzer is very cautious in making any comparison between humans and fly behaviour, for example. <br/><br/>Weiner on the other hand uses emotional formulations like 'Biologists who hate sociobiology maintain that we can learn very little about human nature by studying the instincts of other animals' (p 216) - it's not that I <i>hate</i> sociobiology, it's that I think that a lot of people (journalists more than scientists) hype it more than it deserves. Weiner presents some examples of genes in human behaviour that by now are outdated, and he gives them more merit than they deserve, even back then. For example, he links Xq28 stronger to human male homosexuality more than the evidence of the 90s allows for (IMHO). In these parts the book clearly shows its age, biology has become more cautious in the last decade. A very recent example is the discovery of <a href='http://www.nature.com/news/male-researchers-stress-out-rodents-1.15106'>how the mere presence of male researchers influences the behaviour of laboratory mice</a>.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance to me was the treatment of Lewontin in this book, Weiner presents him as some kind of outdated cold war relic, something like the last Marxist, a unicorn of science - if I remember correctly, he's the only one given negative adjectives in the book ('he's loathed and feared', p 256). I've read other things by Lewontin - he had quite a bit of influence in evolutionary biology that this book omits, he published a bit with Stephen Jay Gould, and his thinking is still influential (and should be more widely spread). I don't think he deserves to be loathed - can someone be loathed who co-invented <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isadore_Nabi'>Isadore Nabi</a>? [1]<br/><br/>But it's still a good book, just take it with a grain of salt (as <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/736269411?book_show_action=false&page=1'>Bastian</a> correctly says) - it pulls some of the 'quieter', maybe slightly forgotten characters of science into the foreground.<br/><br/>Recommended for: <br/>- People who want to know what a single person can achieve in their life with inspiration and lots of hard work.<br/>- People interested in the history of science, especially genetics.<br/><br/>[1] Now that I think about it, Isadore Nabi should have gotten <a href='http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2853'>the first statue of Darwin looking doubtful</a> for his essay <a href='http://www.autodidactproject.org/other/sn-nabi1.html'>An Evolutionary Interpretation of the English Sonnet</a>.<br/><br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Update 2014-7-1:<br/><br/>For those interested, one of the chapters describes how the <i>period</i> gene may have something to do with a supposed courtship song in <i>Drosophila</i>: last week research was published that showed this song is just an artefact of data binning. <a href='http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2014/06/26/can-you-show-us-that-again-please/'>Here's the blog post</a> by the lead author.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

He had little possessions and like a world-citizen he travelled from collaborator to collaborator's couch, staying at each house for a few weeks until another theorem was proven.<br/><br/>Since it's a book about an influential mathematician, pretty much all of the greats of mathematics show up, so the book doubles as a history of modern mathematics, starting with Gauss. If you're into maths some parts of the books might bore you, as the book often sidesteps to explain the background of a particular proof or problem, which you'll probably have heard of already. If you're not into maths, the book might kindle a new love for you, who knows. The author clearly works to make the proofs and conundrums understandable for 'ordinary' people.<br/><br/>Erdős was clearly full of love, always visiting mathematicians' mothers, looking after other peoples' children, never very caring about the order or status of collaborations on papers' authors [1], eschewing wealth and stability for a life of doing what he loved, often donating what money he had to a particular cause he read about in the newspaper, or sending it to struggling mathematicians. In that regard, the book's title isn't <i>that</i> well-chosen, it's probably based on his lack of romantic and sexual love - the book hints towards a severe phimosis or something similar, and a general lack of understanding of women. <br/><br/>The book shines in fun anecdotes about Erdős' life - he buttered his first bread at the ripe old age of 21, he never had a driver's license, he was extremely dependent on his mother, he usually gave away what little money he had, he got lost on a 5-minutes walk, on seeing the solution for the Monty Hall Problem he got angry and didn't understand it for a few days (that made me feel better - that particular solution is so counter-intuitive, I'm still not sure I understood it), he called children epsilons, God the Supreme Fascist, women bosses, he read only one fiction novel in his life (<a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland'>Flatland</a>, what else?) and more..<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who like interesting people.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Heartless robots.<br/><br/>[1] I can talk for hours how picky scientists can get about that, entire projects with hundreds of scientists have been severely delayed because some ego insisted on being author Nr. 12 instead of 13. It's one of the more annoying aspects of scientific work.<br/><br/>P.S.: I want to steal his epitaph: 'Finally, I am becoming stupider no more'",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Onoda was trained in guerilla warfare by the Japanese army and had been sent to a small island in the Philippines to fight the war against the Americans. Unusual for Japanese soldiers, he had been explicitly forbidden from committing suicide and had been allowed to be captured. His orders were to cause mayhem until the Japanese army would sent explicit orders or would come to pick him up. That never happened, so he stayed for 30 years until a student found him in 1974.<br/><br/>The book becomes most interesting when he describes his mental acrobatics to keep on fighting - other Japanese often came looking for him, dropped leaflets on the island, called for him via speakers, but he always found some minor mistake or flaw to convince him that these people were impostors sent by the enemy to trap him. Newspapers saying that the war was lost with pictures of Japanese in their cities were obvious fakes - if Japan had lost, all Japanese people, including children and women, would have died fighting! It didn't really help either that the Philippine army used the island to train bombing runs (<i>genius</i> idea - train where you know that there are still guerillas hiding) - what would you think if you were stuck in an imagined war, but the planes dropping bombs were real? <br/><br/>He never got the official order to stand down, so he never stopped fighting, which he did by terrorizing the poor islanders, burning their rice, shooting at them, stealing from them.<br/><br/>Sadly, the autobiography is slightly insincere. Onoda describes shooting in the general direction of people and never mentions whether he actually hit someone, but <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroo_Onoda'>Wikipedia</a> says he killed several islanders.<br/><br/>Onoda died just 5 months ago. This book seems to have been forgotten since it came out in the 70s - I got it for a dollar at the Lifeline bookfest.<br/><br/>Recommended for: 1) People who are into survivor manuals. Want to know how to store ammunition in the jungle? Collect the bullets in a glass bottle, put coconut oil on the bullet to prevent rusting, close the bottle with a steel cap to prevent rats from eating the coconut oil! <i>You're welcome!</i> (The book has helpful drawings too)<br/>2) People interested in reading about how your psychology can bend your reality<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Glover doesn't offer many solutions for the future (maybe in another book?) except that we need political restraints on a world scale (but: if you have a world police, that police can kill without problems) and we need to learn how to develop ethics and psychology in the face of technology that enables us to kill men, women, children at the press of a button.<br/><br/>A few personal takeaways:<br/><br/>- People <i>actually learn from history</i>, and they actually <i>learn from books!</i> During the Cuba Missile Crisis the Soviets cited their personal war experience and Kennedy cited the First World War, especially Tuchman's <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11366.The_Guns_of_August'>Guns of August</a>, as reasons why they did not want to continue the conflict (as a sidenote, reading the letters and opinions of the US military leaders who wanted to keep the conflict going makes you realize how realistic Jack D. Ripper in Dr. Strangelove is)<br/><br/>- History repeats itself, all the time; when the Athenians attacked the Melians, they 'presented [their] hard amoralism as mere realism'. Everyone else has done that since, here in Australia the current government clouds their inhumanity in the guise of 'adults being in charge'.<br/><br/>- In a way, the First World War was present at Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Glover makes a nice case how the 'modern' sliding of standards in regards to the death of civilians in wartime started at the blockade of Hamburg in WW1, went on to the indiscriminate bombing of civilians from Germans and the British, and culminated in the atomic bombs. If this book would have come out later it would have included indiscriminate drone killings in the Middle East in that slide.<br/><br/>- Internet trolls with absolute horrifying opinions in the comment section of news-articles are nothing new:<br/><blockquote><br/>[...] another American massacre of Japanese survivors in lifeboats provoked a letter of moral criticism, which was published. Many of the replies to that letter claimed that Japanese atrocities justified the massacre. One reader wrote of 'killing a helpless rattlesnake'. Another had 'thoroughly enjoyed' reading about the slaughter'. Another said that a 'good old American custom I would like to see is nailing a Jap hide on every ""backhouse"" door in America'.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>- Glover doesn't like Heidegger in the slightest: 'The inarticulate complexity is Heidegger's trademark. Can someone whose thinking is so blurred be a serious philosopher?' Or even better (you have to know that Heidegger once wrote that Hitler's hands were beautiful):<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>To imagine a meeting between them, with Heidegger glancing at Hitler's marvellous hands and talking about the unity of the outside-of-itself in the raptures of the future, is to be reminded how easily the Führer was moved to rage. That the two men did not meet is one of surrealism's great losses in the twentieth century.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Not recommended for: <br/>1) The squeamish. Every atrocity is introduced with several personal eyewitness accounts, it makes for good nightmare material. In fact, I think I had weird nightmares every single night while reading this book (but: correlation != causation)<br/>2) People who love people, your beliefs might take a punch:<br/><blockquote><br/>The widespread enthusiasm even now for capital punishment seems to reflect something more than a concern to reduce crime rates. When capital punishment was the law in Britain, there were about five applications a week for the post of executioner.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in changing the future by learning from the past.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Schrödinger tries to summarize how physics and chemistry can help solve biology's problems, like how information is actually inherited. He often comes so close to the actual truth that you want to shout at the book while reading it - I wonder what he would have done with Rosalind Franklin's X-Ray diffraction images of DNA.... <br/><br/>In other times he's a bit lost, like when he thinks that new physical laws are needed to solve the riddle of heredity; as far as I know, we didn't need to come up with new laws. I don't think that's his fault, though: he was just hypothesizing from the data available to him at that time.<br/><br/>One of the cooler concepts Schrödinger introduces is the concept of life as a system that ""eats"" entropy and thereby evades thermodynamic equilibrium, as predicted by the second law of thermodynamics.<br/><br/>The book itself is further proof that scientists never operate in an intellectual vacuum, every great discovery is based on preceeding thougts. Both Watson and Crick, the discoverers of the DNA-structure, had read the book. Without it I doubt they would have thought of the structure the way they did.<br/><br/>The second book ""Mind and Matter"" is much more philosophical in nature and concerns free will, the self and how we perceive the world. Here Schrödinger quotes Indian scripture to make his point that the subject and object are one, conciousness isn't as clear cut as people commonly believe, etc. If you're into that this part will bore you. It did, however, contain a small discussion of cultural heredity in the form of ""Mnemes"" - something which has been popularized by Dawkins in the last few decades.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of science, it's so short you can read it in an afternoon. People interested in the history of science, What Is Life? is one of the most influental scientific books of the last 100 years (judging on how many scientists cite it as their prime inspiration to get into biology).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Sometimes, entire pages seem to have been machine-translated from German, to which Feyerabend added Greek and Latin quotes, and cites ten different philosophers and forgotten authors to make the confusion complete. I had to look up quite a few English words (incommensurable, counter-inductive, etc.). But then suddenly, the next 5 pages are crystal clear and genius! <br/><br/>To summarize his points: Scientific conduct and progress is much more chaotic and ""law-less"" than proponents and practitioners of science realize. He makes his point by showing how Galileo didn't win Europe over to Copernicanism by showing a theory that explained reality ""better"" (as one would assume), Galileo won everyone over by inventing a few tools, hiding a few inconvenient datapoints, being a good propagandist, and a lot of trickery.<br/><br/>For me as a scientist reading Against Method is freeing. There is a break in between how we do science and how we present it to the public - for example, the structure of a scientific publiction has absolutely nothing to do with how the actual results were obtained. In my case with bioinformatics, I start to play around with data, and walk down 500 paths of which 499 don't work. I get some interesting results, and try to make sense of them by looking through the literature, and I finally find some biological phenomenon that might fit. Using that phenomenon as a start, I think how I can prove or disprove it - find one way to prove it - and write the paper. This has nothing to do with the scientific method of hypothesis -> prediction -> testing with data, yet the publication I write follows this structure (I also do not list the 499 things I tried, thereby ""inventing"" a story that is cleaner than reality). <a href=""http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=761"">PHDComics had this fitting comic a few years ago</a>.<br/><br/>Feyerabend correctly sees that stringent application of the ""rules"" of science would make science impossible. For example, if falsification were to be applied stringently we simply couldn't have bioinformatics. Play around with one of the settings in your genome assembler, and you get a slightly different genome - which one is the correct one? If I computationally predict genes in a genome, I get around 400,000 genes. Which ones do really exist? <br/><br/>There are surely ways to falsify this, but the technology does not exist (or it's a tedious, expensive and literally life-consuming work). As long as the technology does not exist, we proceed and publish: ""anything goes"". This makes science much more a field of play than people realize. Schools do not teach this: according to what I learned in high school about science, I should be much more stuffy and strict. Yet a large part of my work is playing around in an R console, looking for fun things, making pretty pictures, and drinking free coffee.<br/><br/>Where I don't agree with Feyerabend in the slightest is his demand to split science from politics - I can understand where he's coming from, I guess up until the 80s the results of science where set in stone. What the scientist said was ""true"", to the detriment of science itself; Feyerabend says that there are other systems alternative to science that are as good as, or even ""better"" than ""Western science"" - he makes the case for traditional Chinese science & medicine, which by now is known to be mostly Placebo effect. I can't agree with him at all. The split of science and politics has (partially?) caused the mess we're in now.<br/><br/>Maybe by now, statistics has done the job Feyerabend wanted other systems to do. The introduction of rigid tests, the spreading awareness of problems like the multiple comparisons problem, too small sample sizes and more, the availability of online anonymous comments etc., has helped to ""dethrone"" scientific results. <br/><br/>I also can understand why scientists rarely read philosopy of science. Large parts of this book serve as counter-arguments to Popper and Lakatos, I rarely understood anything there, since I've read very little philosophy of science.. Plus I, like most scientists, don't understand Latin or Greek.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Practitioners and ""fans"" of science, it's eye-opening.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Karma exists but it it's more useful for reincarnation - there is no all-encompassing ""good"" like in the Christian worldview.<br/><br/>The entire folklore of Japanese yokai is fascinating, and Hearn touches on some of them, like the Yuki-Onna, but it's often feels like Hearn influences the stories too much.<br/><br/>The last few chapters are all weird, starting with an autobiographical story of Hearn that I did not particularly care for, then continuing with a strange description of Horai, a mythical Chinese and Japanese place, but the description differs from anything else in the Japanese literature and must have been mostly invented by Hearn. Sadly, this ""taints"" the other preceding stories: I can't tell whether Hearn influenced them, or if they're ""proper"" Japanese stories. <br/><br/>Even weirder is the finishing chapter with Hearn's thoughts on butterflies, mosquitoes and ants. Interestingly he described that ants keep mushrooms, I thought that was a more recent discovery.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Fans of Japan, and those who like Folklore stories.

When Tolkien creates the world of LOTR, he gives the reader only a glimpse of what Tolkien has built - he tells you that there are a ton of different races, but in the story not all of them appear; Tolkien tells you that all of these races have complete, twisted, intertwined back-stories, but gives you only a glimpse, as much as you need to know. Butcher, on the other hand, creates only exactly as much back story as needed - there are 3 types of werewolves, ergo all of them have to appear (however ham-fisted their inclusion in the story is [1]), he tells you all there is about them (not much) and then has all the characters act out all there is to them, nothing is left to the fog... In other words: if Butcher had directed the original Star Wars trilogy, Boba Fett wouldn't have had a helmet.<br/><br/>And, I get that most of the characters are wolves, but honestly, using 'he/she/it snarled' instead of the classic 'he said' gets tiring fast.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The outdoor propaganda is Juche Thought, a relatively inconsistent quasi-Communist waffling no-one really bothers to understand or 'fix'. The internal propaganda (called 'the Text' in the book) is interesting - a racist national set of ideas, initially copied from the Japanese under Hirohito, and then amended over the decades. <br/><br/>The Koreans are the 'purest' people, and since they're so 'pure' they need protection from the outside world from the Dear Leader, the most Korean Korean. The Koreans are a child-like race too pure, under constant threat from  outside evils such as 'Yankees', diverse 'puppet regimes' of the Yankees like the South Koreans, and other threats to their purity. It's a little bit like North Koreans see themselves like one of these overbred dogs who can't walk up stairs on his own.<br/><br/>This is all very interesting to learn, especially as the depth of Western media's reporting on the DPRK can be summarized as 'look at these weirdos lololol here's the weather' Myers seems to have strong opinions on other Western DPRK researchers, and since I know very little about North Koreans, I can't judge how accurate he is. In fact, if what this book says it's true, it's going to be much, much more difficult to change the political situation in North Korea than it was in East Germany - East Germans saw the economical success of West Germany and wanted the same which was one of the factors leading to collapse, North Korea sees the economical success of South Korea and treats it as a sign of their 'unpure' depravity. Even if the military leadership is replaced or eliminated like in Iraq, people won't be cheering - you can't just replace an entire mythology, taught over 50 years, over night and think people will accept you.<br/><br/>Sadly this book is a bit short, and was published before Kim Jong-un became leader/president/head honcho. I would've liked to read what Myers thinks of Kim Jong-un - he certainly seems to portray the 'child-like' in the North Korean mythology very well [1]. As a biologist, I would have also liked to read more about the 'scientific' side of the racist myth, since the Soviet Union had their own science (Lysenkoism) and ran experiments etc. Does that scientific side even exist?<br/><br/>Bonus fact: You can read this book pretending it's about an alien race on Venus and it still works!<br/><br/>Recommended for: People interested in authoritarian regimes, different ways to view the world, Korea, communism, and those who like to read excerpts from strange, alien novels.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People who like to cling to their belief that North Korea is led by a bunch of bumbling fools.<br/><br/>[1] Seriously, on all official pictures he looks like a fat baby.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The author instilled the mistakes and successes of his work on the IBM 360 Operating System in the 70s, and most of what he found still applies today. For example, wisdom like: more programmers make a project only late, and if you add programmers to an already late project, results will arrive even later. Have an architect and a manager, hopefully in two different persons. Have version control (since the book is old, it's more of a central repository of printed (!!) books that detail all changes, the outline, the design etc.). There is no silver bullet - software is inherently complex and there will never be a single technology which makes it fast/easy/cheap/error-free.<br/><br/>A large portion of the knowledge contained is more useful large companies or large projects, where you have 100 to a 1000 programmers working at the same time, so for me as a lonely bioinformatician toiling on my own code not everything is applicable.

There's mutilation, murder, rape, and all of these on every second page or so.<br/><br/>Set in an unspecified Eastern European state during WW2, this book details how the 10-year old narrator is separated from his parents and has to survive by drifting from tiny village to village (up until this point it's a lot like Ballard's Empire Of The Sun). Since he looks marginally different than others he's not welcome anywhere - most think he's either a Jew or a gypsy.<br/><br/>Interestingly, most of the terror and brutality in this book doesn't come from the war itself, but from the brutal stupidity and superstitions of the villagers. Ironically, the war saves the narrator several times - the Nazi army saves him twice, and the Soviet army heals his broken ribs and gives him a home. At one point, the narrator even sees Jesus in an SS-officer. <br/><br/>It's not really a book about the brutality of war - I'd argue the motif is more like 'those who belong to the group versus the outsider'. The book is full of these manifestations, war is just one manifestation of the theme. Every time the narrator arrives in a new village, he is punished for being an outsider. The holocaust itself is being portrayed as outsiders being punished by the group  (There is one brutal scene which describes how the villagers comb the tracks next to the trains going to the death-camps for anything of value, left by the prisoners; the villagers find an escaped Jewish woman, but the villagers don't help her escape - instead, is subsequently raped and killed. After all, 'she's just a Jew', an outsider). The title-giving Painted Bird is another manifestation of the theme.<br/><br/>Is all the brutality in this book realistic? I'd say yes, judging from what I heard in Germany growing up. But it isn't autobiographical in the strict sense, which seems to have disappointed a lot of people when it came out (and looking over them, some Goodreads reviews still seem to assume that it's autobiographical). If it were strictly a true story then life has more symbolism than I remembered. But that doesn't mean that the book is untrue - all of these things happened.<br/><br/>Recommended for: I'm not sure, honestly.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Fans of The Book Thief. The squeamish.

There's a bit of essays on Wallace, his success and suicide around the interviews from Lipsky, but the majority of the books is Wallace's answers and elaborations of answers to questions of Lipsky. I'd say 80% of the text is Wallace speaking, and it's great to read the thoughts of someone who's so upfront and honest about himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>What I’m trying to say to you is, I went through a period so bad, that that stuff had to stop mattering to me, or I think I would’ve blown my brains out. I came reasonably close.</blockquote> <br/><br/>From time to time Lipsky injects his personal observations into the texts with [brackets like this], which feels like Lipsky is trying to remind the reader that Lipsky still exists, they don't add much and often break the flow of the answer.<br/><br/>Worthy of a read just because of this quote (and now I spoiled it for you!)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I think the reason why people behave in an ugly manner is that it’s really scary to be alive and to be human, and people are really really afraid. And that the reasons [...] That the fear is the basic condition, and there are all kinds of reasons for why we’re so afraid. But the fact of the matter is, is that, is that the job that we’re here to do is to learn how to live in a way that we’re not terrified all the time. And not in a position of using all kinds of different things, and using people to keep that kind of terror at bay. That is my personal opinion.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>Addendum: Both Lipsky and Wallace were huge TV-watchers, with a section on how both can easily watch TV for 6-8 hours straight - is it just me or has that died? I know no-one who can watch that much TV without doing anything else, I can't watch TV <i>alone</i> for longer than 10 minutes before I open my laptop. Changing times?<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Makes you realize that your smallest actions can have huge consequences somewhere else.<br/><br/>As it's normal with hard SF, all characters are made out of cardboard, just there to progress the story.

17660462,The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,Brad Stone,"Stone, Brad",,"=""0316219266""","=""9780316219266""",4,4.13,"Little, Brown and Company",Hardcover,384,2013,2013,2014/03/17,2014/02/19,business-time,business-time (#1),read,"(Part of a conscious effort to read books about ""adults"" and in the process hopefully become more of an ""adult"", whatever that is)<br/><br/>Things I learned from this book:<br/><br/>1. Working at Amazon isn't much fun, in fact it's kind of terrifying<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>People left and afterward they took a breath and felt disoriented, like they had escaped a cult. Though they didn’t share it openly, many just couldn’t take working for Bezos any longer. He demanded more than they could possibly deliver and was extremely stingy with praise. At the same time, many felt a tremendous loyalty to Bezos and would later marvel at how much they accomplished at Amazon. Kim Rachmeler shared a favorite quote she heard from a colleague around that time. “If you’re not good, Jeff will chew you up and spit you out. And if you’re good, he will jump on your back and ride you into the ground.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Managers in departments of fifty people or more are required to “top-grade” their subordinates along a curve and must dismiss the least effective performers. As a result of this ongoing examination, many Amazon employees live in perpetual fear. A common experience among Amazon workers is a feeling of genuine surprise when one receives a good performance review. Managers are so parsimonious with compliments that underlings tend to spend their days anticipating their termination.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(But: I used to work under similar ""screamy"" people, so I learned to just ignore their tantrums, so all fine on that front?)<br/><br/>2. but it can also be inspiring and apparently you learn heaps [1]:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff does a couple of things better than anyone I’ve ever worked for,” Dalzell says. “He embraces the truth. A lot of people talk about the truth, but they don’t engage their decision-making around the best truth at the time. “The second thing is that he is not tethered by conventional thinking. What is amazing to me is that he is bound only by the laws of physics. He can’t change those. Everything else he views as open to discussion.”<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>3. And since Amazon has become such a huge market-power, they've behaved more than dodgy (and Bezos' sayings like ""Customer first"" sound hollow)<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Amazon had an easy way to demonstrate its market power. When a publisher did not capitulate and the company shut off the recommendation algorithms for its books, the publisher’s sales usually fell by as much as 40 percent. “Typically it was about thirty days before they’d come back and say, Ouch, how do we make this work?” says Christopher Smith, a senior book buyer at the time.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>4. Several passages reminded me of <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10091466-inside-scientology"">Inside Scientology</a>, in the description of ""Jeff bots"", people who try to emulate Bezos in thinking and behaviour tcoming close to Hubbard's Sea Org:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>“Jeff was learning as he went along. He learned things from each of us who had expertise and incorporated the best pieces into his mental model. Now everyone is expected to think as much as they can like Jeff.” Bezos’s top executives are always modeling Bezos-like behavior.<br/></blockquote> <br/><br/>So would I recommend this book? I learned that Amazon had more failures than successes, which is good to know - in retrospect it all looks like one huge success story. It also explains recent developments like Amazon's drone program, Bezos isn't scared of having far-out ideas and then pursuing them relentlessly. <br/><br/>One thing that scares me is the similarity to Apple's Steve Jobs - both not really nice people to work under, and both willing to bend and break ethics to get what they wanted. ""Some"" people see that as the reason for their success and try to emulate this behaviour. You can be extremely successful and not sell your soul - look at <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13482884-our-daily-bread-the-essential-norman-borlaug"">Norman Borlaug</a>, father of the green revolution, also founder of the Mexican softball league, who made sure that all of his ""lower level"" employees received university education. Or look at Valve's Steve Gaben, who gives sick employees the official job-title of ""getting better"" and pays them until they are OK again. Bezos doesn't even pay parking fees.<br/><br/>[1] yay for Australian English: Mixing data-structures and language since 1901<br/><br/>Addendum:<br/><br/>Where does success come from? It seems that most of the current Silicon Valley higher-ups had very good childhoods, with special schools, extremely early access to computers, special schooling programs for gifted children, etc. Look at Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. At the same time, their adult versions worked extremely hard, much more than 99% of the rest of the world, and of course had luck at the right time, and were uncompromising in their ""big thinking"".

If not, just watch <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ4KzClb1C4"">this scene</a>. Needless to say, it's <b>great</b>: ""Oh hi Mark!"". <br/><br/>If you ever wondered how that movie came to be, here's The Disaster Artist, by one of the movie's co-stars: Greg Sestero (who's Mark in the above scene). Did you know it cost 6 million dollars? Did you know it took forever to film? Did you know Wiseau kept on forgetting basic sentences <b>he himself wrote</b>? Did you know still no-one really knows where all this money came from? Did you know Wiseau is as weird in real life as he is in the movie?<br/><br/>Here Sestero describes how he met Wiseau at acting school, how he tried to get his acting career to start, his continuing friendship with Wiseau (and absolute bafflement about Wiseau, the alien/vampire/dork?), culminating in Wiseau making <i>The Room</i>, and the absolute trainwreck of the filming, which form the main part of the book. It's also the funniest.<br/><br/>The best thing about this book is that Sestero could have taken the low road of just making fun of Wiseau's absolute weirdness, and it would have destroyed the book. But instead, we get introspective sentences like this:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>In the end, the phenomenon of The Room has allowed me to realize that, in life, anything is possible. The Room is a drama that is also a comedy that is also an existential cry for help that is finally a testament to human endurance. It has made me reconsider what defines artistic success or failure.

Another story with an ""industry espionage detective"" first dragged on forever and it felt like Barron wanted to go into cyberpunk territory, but then turned 180 degrees and became a horror story that reminded me more of Barker's Hellraiser (chains! blood! torture!) than Lovecraft's stuff.

Thomas Ligotti has built himself a nice house in that valley.<br/><br/>To summarize the thesis of this non-fiction book/treatise: being alive is <i>not</i> alright, optimists are deceiving themselves and others, the future will <i>not</i> be better, the creation of consciousness was a huge mistake, life is useless and painful to boot, and humanity would do itself a favor by collectively deciding to not have children anymore: to stop perpetuate this madness. <br/><br/>To quote:<br/><br/><blockquote>Consciousness makes it seem as if (1) there is something to do; (2) there is somewhere to go; (3) there is something to be; (4) there is someone to know. This is what makes consciousness the parent of all horrors, the thing that makes us try to do something, go somewhere, be something, and know someone, such as ourselves, so that we can escape our MALIGNANTLY USELESS being and think that being alive is all right rather than that which should not be.</blockquote> (yes, MALIGNANTLY USELESS is always capitalized)<br/><br/>or<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Beef, pork, sometimes goat—they go into us and come out of us. This is part of the regimen of nonsense that nature forced upon us. But it is not all the nonsense we must endure as we go to and fro on the earth and walk up and down upon it. The nature nonsense, the God nonsense. How much nonsense can we take in our lives? And is there any way we can escape it? No, there is not. We are doomed to all kinds of nonsense: the pain nonsense, the nightmare nonsense, the sweat and slave nonsense, and many other shapes and sizes of insufferable nonsense. It is brought to us on a plate, and we must eat it up or face the death nonsense.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>He quotes extensively from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wessel_Zapffe"">Zapffe</a>, Schopenhauer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philipp_Mainl%C3%A4nder"">Mainländer</a>, Lovecraft (awesome) and others to make his case - sometimes, the book feels more like an expansion of Zapffe's ideas... Neither Zapffe nor Mainländer were known to me before; I guess both are reasonably unknown, since the majority of Zapffe's work remains untranslated.<br/><br/>But: there is a dark strange form of humor at work here; reading the book I couldn't help but think that getting drunk with Ligotti must be great fun.<br/><br/>You do see that he's got a background as a horror writer:<br/><br/><blockquote>We are aberrations—beings born undead, neither one thing nor another, or two things at once … uncanny things that have nothing to do with the rest of creation, horrors that poison the world by sowing our madness everywhere we go, glutting daylight and darkness with incorporeal obscenities.</blockquote><br/><br/>Recommended for: Remember the Nietzsche quote, ""when you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you""? This book is for people who love getting into staring contests with the abyss.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Psychologically labile people. Teddy Daniels from Shutter Island.

The twins are deserted, people die, people ""get disappeared"" under the regime, no-one is <i>ever</i> happy. <br/><br/>The first book was the strongest; narrated by the twins themselves, using extremely reduced and spare language, it's often shocking how desensitized both have made themselves to their surroundings. The spare language makes the brutality machine-like. Due to the brutality and suffering, which is contradicted by the twins' ""genius"" and ""otherworldliness"" (they're a bit like the children in Village Of The Damned) the first book feels more like a bleak fairytale, the second and third books are not as bleak (people actually have names in these!) and the third book even has something of a twist.<br/><br/>The two things I copied from this book: <br/><br/>'I say, ""Yes. No book, no matter how sad, can be as sad as a life.""' <br/><br/>and <br/><br/>""I tell him that life is totally useless, that it's nonsense, an aberration, infinite suffering, the invention of a non-God whose evil surpasses understanding.""<br/><br/>Bonus fact: The famous Japanese Super Nintendo roleplaying game Mother 3 is partially based on the first book.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Both books seem to be worried about the militarization of the treatment of both cancer and AIDS, as in ""the war on cancer""/""the war on AIDS"" and all that follows of these ways of thinking (including calls for internment of HIV-positive people etc.).<br/><br/>The first book on tuberculosis/cancer is more outdated than the second - I rarely encounter many points it refutes, much of which was spread in the early to mid 19th European literature, for example, that cancer is due to (paraphrased) someone not really being in contact with their feelings. I think only hippies still believe that. It's also weird that the book so often refutes points made by Georg Groddeck and Wilhelm Reich, both of which are now mostly known for their crazy ideas and not much else (I remember a poor soul who had to hold a talk about Groddeck's ""The Book Of The It"" in high school German, to the general amusement of everyone - I mean, ""you break your leg only if you want to?"" what is <i>that</i>)<br/><br/>The second book on AIDS is better, but contains a bit of repetition from the first one (since both were published several years apart). <br/><br/><br/>Recommended for: Skeptics who want to see someone refute common beliefs of their time.

Maybe because I grew up in Germany? Do we have different childhoods? I don't think so..<br/><br/>Here we have Charlie, a highly intelligent, slightly mentally ill 15-year old (later 16) who writes letters about his daily life. Since he's so intelligent he hangs out with the older crowd, a couple of 17/18-year olds at his high-school. <br/><br/>The first half of the book was bad. Charlie doesn't think like a 15-year old, he and his friends think like mature, respectful 30-year olds. The biggest concern to me was the total and absolute lack of awkwardness, which to me is the major feeling of that certain age: most kisses at that age are ""he stuck his tongue so deep into my throat that I threw up"" [1], here kisses are beautiful and perfect moments forever stuck in time. Most social events at that age are ""she's young, she can't judge drinking, she drank so much Jägermeister in 20 minutes that she threw up on me"" [2], in this book they are gatherings of like-minded artists who read each other poetry. That is the worst part - everyone is such a unique quirky snowflake (we discuss The Smiths! We read poetry! We make punk zines! We drive pickups! We drink brandy!); no-one is really a character, everyone is just there to allude to pop culture. Of course there has to be a gay couple there as well, they're not gay because of the way the characters are but they are gay so that the book can be oh-so-progressive. It reminded me a lot of the movie Juno, where similarly everybody is quirky for quirkiness' sake.<br/><br/>The second half got better: Chbosky perfectly captures the moment when your childhood friendships dissolve and everybody starts their own life; you get nostalgic for that time. But then you realize that he knows he inflicts these emotions, you feel that he constructed this not to write ""the truth"" but to toy with your emotions, and that is when you feel like taking a shower. After I finished the book I would've given it 3 or 4 stars mainly because of these scenes; now a day later the effect has worn off, luckily. <br/><br/>On the language: Some of these one-off sentences like ""at this moment, we felt infinite"" feel painfully cheesy like Coelho, it's not even funny.<br/><br/>[1] Disclaimer: Never happened to me<br/><br/>[2] Disclaimer: Happened to me",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Then the book goes over to the coup d'etat by the current boss David Miscavige, details the death of Lisa McPherson and the personal role of Miscavige in it, the ""star power"" strategy of Scientology (you know, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, surprisingly to me: Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson), and concludes with the current rise of splinter-groups who agree with Hubbard's teaching but don't agree with how the church is handled.<br/><br/>What will make you angry is the ""evil"" (for lack of a better term) done by the church or its followers. The harassment of IRS-personnel to get a ""tax exempt"" status, the harassment of ex-members, the non-relenting suing of everyone not agreeing with Scientology, the creepiness of Hubbard and Miscavige (Hubbard had a personal staff of 15-year old girls as ""messengers"" who ran his errands for him, held his drinks, lighted his cigarettes etc. - Miscavige regularly beats people up and plays cruel mind-games, like forcing all of his staff to play ""around the world or they're 'out'"", which leads to physical fights between people for chairs), the shameful story of McPherson's death (Miscavige personally declared her ""Clear"" so a nervous breakdown should be impossible, but she suffered a nervous breakdown, since that wasn't possible they kept her under wraps and didn't give her much medical help. She died of dehydration which the church immediately started to cover up. The coroner changed her report later [it is implied under personal pressure by Scientology] so that the organization didn't get sued). So much more: The weirdness of the whole Tom Cruise-involvement is worth to read this book alone.<br/><br/>It makes you happy that Germany officially sees Scientology as a cult.<br/><br/>It was a bit discomforting to read that some of my fav. Golden Age SF writers like AE Van Vogt were early Dianetics-followers, but I expected that from the more crazier authors like Burroughs (or even guys like Manson). Also surprised to see that the Nation of Islam (Malcolm X's church for half of his life until they kicked him out, see his auto-biography) has moved closer and closer to Scientology, they're now teaching Dianetics.<br/><br/>The only positive things I took away from the book is that currently, Scientology is bleeding high-level members because Miscavige treats everyone like the complete sociopath he seems to be, and that Scientology has less members than I thought - by one count in 2008, 25,000 in the US.<br/><br/>Recommended for: those who need more proof that the most damage is done by people who think they're doing ""good"".

A human is sent to one of the outer Sirian planets to stir things up. The protagonist is sent with unlimited money and advanced tech to impersonate an entire rebel army by distributing propaganda, killing people, bombing people etc. There is no moral in here since Sirians are Others and the ones he kills are always overtly characterized as being ""evil"", no ambiguity there. How he succeeds at his terrorist mission is at times fun and at times surprisingly well-thought out.<br/><br/>Without spoilering too much, the ending is actually exactly like I would imagine such a story in real life to end. No overtly heroic stuff, that was unexpected from books of the era - you would expect the guy with the chiseled chin to ride off into the sunset with the love of his life.<br/><br/>Of course, since it's Golden Age SF the protagonist is one-dimensional (feelings are boring, characters are boring, let's have more story), overpowered (unlimited money!

However, this book is impossible to finish.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the elves, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Elves taught him magic, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>No wait, that was wrong.<br/><br/>The story: A human, after he grew up with the martians, is returned to humankind. Mankind's society is alien to him but lucky for him the Martians taught him special powers, for example, he can make people and things vanish with the power of this thoughts.<br/><br/>Yes, that's more like it. As you can see, I don't think this book is much science fiction: yes, it has spaceships, but no, it doesn't have the <i>great ideas</i> of science-fiction. All this offers is fantasy's escapism, and Heinlein's crude ideas, his own imitation of science-fiction's <i>ideas</i>.<br/><br/>Oh, the ideas: It seems that every time Heinlein had an idea he had to write an SF-book about the idea, explaining why it's the greatest idea ever and every body should follow it.<br/><br/>Starship Troopers? ""Military dictatorship is the best thing, here's half a book of lectures on the topic with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress? ""Libertarianism is best, here's half a book of lectures with some fight scenes in between.""<br/><br/>And this one, Stranger In A Strange Land? ""Polygamy is best, here's a science-fiction book with the latter half being lectures."" To be precise, this book is more about polygyny, and of course only heterosexual!<br/><br/>The women in this book seem to fail the Bechdel test: one of the main protagonists of this book is female and I swear 99% of her thoughts are either about the Man From Mars or about her fiancee. She doesn't seem to have her own motivations, which goes for the other female characters, as well.<br/><br/>And then the writing and plotting - Heinlein seems to be the king of the overpowered Deus Ex Machina, having the Man From Mars always learn new magic tricks when the situation calls for it. The protagonists always have the upper hand, they're never truly in danger. Are they being attacked? Shazam, The Man Form Mars can ""wish"" people away. Is the Man From Mars stuck somewhere? Abracadabra, he can leave his body and, I don't know, ""walk on the astral plane""? That's how Doctor Strange does it. The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress does this as well, by the way - the protagonists have that massively overpowered, invincible AI on their side. In gaming terms: Heinlein is the king of buffing.<br/><br/>So yeah, I can't understand how and why people love Heinlein so much - I guess its an overhang from their childhoods (which also explains why everybody loves the infantile Enders Game so much).<br/><br/>tl;dr avoid!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Sagan is certainly no poet, the language in this book is concise and to the point - no flowery similes, no poetic parts, it's pure story (and large parts of the story don't even have protagonists, it's just descriptions of what's going on internationally).<br/><br/>Sagan's experience on government bodies is clearly showing in this book, it's surprisingly heavy on international, science and office politics. A bit funny that in this book, the Soviet Union still exists in 1999. <br/><br/>The biggest spot of bother is the ending. It's a weird, vague thing - of course, a human author who tries to describe a species that far surpasses humans in every aspect can only fail. Sagan found a nice way to sneak out of that dilemma, but then he destroys it by having the main character find a message in Pi, just like that? I mean, people have been automatically computing Pi for decades now, it feels illogical that the main character can do that on her own.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

As such, I assumed I wouldn't connect with this book as I personally had no clue about what war's like, and after reading I'm pretty sure I'm not the target audience at all, but it was still so <i>interesting</i>.<br/><br/>It's a surprisingly spiritual book about how the US treats its soldiers, how soldiers see themselves and how soldiers are mistreated, based on Marlantes experiences in the Vietnam war. The book draws a lot from Joseph Campbell's stuff on myths and symbolism (Campbell appears several times in the book) but most of it you can still see as just being symbolic - just because Marlantes talks about the god Mars doesn't mean he himself believes that such a god exists, it's just his way to explain the ""inner warrior"". I guess it's geared towards the US public and towards decision makers - war is exhilarating which is a taboo to talk about, but it's also terrible to see your friends die, and for Marlantes there are simply not enough rituals inside the army and for returning veterans to help them cope in order to get back into society.<br/><br/>It's one of the more brutally honest books I've read about war.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks: sometimes the spiritualism is <i>too</i> heavy handed for me, and sometimes it falls into really antiquated gender roles (no wonder when you base it on ""gods"" or a symbol of those - fertility gods are female, war gods are male).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The only problem is that these parts are excruciatingly <i>boring</i> - the first quarter of the book is literally nothing but rich people customizing their garden (with added symbolism), then it becomes interesting once the despair sets in, only to get back to people standing around simulating old pictures (which goes on for <i>way</i> too long), then it gets interesting again.<br/><br/>Goethe was great at characterization without judging - especially Eduard (the ~40 year old main guy) comes off as a spoiled child, but Goethe doesn't beat the reader over the head with it. Of course he then falls in love with the childish girl.<br/><br/>And it's fun to see how many commas fit into a sentence in German, the average must be around 8.<br/><br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Since the author often intersperses her own personal views and experiences working in the field the book feels more like listening to an excited relative explain his or her field at a party than a technical explanation at a conference. <br/><br/>I'm also impressed about the overall <i>niceness</i> of this book - for example, I would've found stronger words about Wolfram's research on cellular automata, which <a href=""http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfram/"">others have</a>. As a rule many of the portrayed more modern scientists seem to have an ego so big that it stands in the way of truth - i.e., their new pet theory is supposed to explain most of biology but is just an oversimplified exercise that quickly falls flat once actual data is incorporated. But again, Mitchell doesn't make fun of these models but sees them as necessary stepping stones towards a better model.<br/><br/>To summarize, <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/766735657"">like Basti said in his review</a>, you got to love a book that brings together so many giants of different scientific disciplines.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

185152,The Dialectical Biologist,Richard Levins,"Levins, Richard",Richard C. Lewontin,"=""067420283X""","=""9780674202832""",4,4.32,Harvard University Press,Paperback,336,1987,1985,2013/11/03,2013/06/04,"biology, marxism","biology (#4), marxism (#1)",read,"This book was published a year before I was born. Since then, I've jumped through most of the hoops society has laid out for budding scientists, and at some point in the next 2 years I should be allowed to call myself a ""Doctor of Philosophy"" or something like that (""burger flipper""?). It has come obvious to me that there's a ton of problems in scientific research, in the scientific community, and in the way research is conducted. It's also very funny to see that a lot of these problems have already been described in this book from 27 years ago. <br/><br/>Basically, it's a collection of essays in the style of Marxist dialectics, i.e., a way of thinking that tries to incorporate entire systems instead of first trying to split a system into its parts and then analyzing these (the Cartesian approach). I'm pretty sure Dialectics has been re-invented as Systems Thinking in recent years by writers like Donna Meadows, even the way the graphs work is mostly identical.<br/><br/>Some interesting points, in no particular order:<br/>- Evolutionary research tries to see the organism as the outcome of evolution, while Levis/Lewontin try to show that organisms also shape their own evolution (for starters, all species shape their environments, starting from their droppings to more complicated things like building nests/burrrows/dams/houses, and much much more).<br/>- Gene/phenotype studies usually model the interaction between both as a one-way, one-to-one interaction, at one point in time, while there's a world outside this small scale which easily falsifies any results. Much of this is currently repeated in criticisms of Genome-wide association studies (GWAS).<br/>- Evolution as a theory is a product of the society it was invented in. It couldn't have been proposed in a stale, ""God-given"" medieval society.<br/>- I didn't realize before how much of Darwin's thinking was shaped by Malthus.<br/>- The Essay on Lysenkoism has some weird points, like that table showing that during the rise and acceptance of Lysenkoism in the Soviet Union, yield grew and was a bit higher than in the US, and that's taken as a minor defense of Lysenkoism. However, just because yield grew doesn't mean that Lysenkoism was good - there could have been millions of reasons why that happened.<br/>- Not sure why the essay on health in the Latin American community is there; it's way too specialized to be of any interest<br/>- I'm pretty sure that each essay is a hidden angry rant about a recent publication, but since these essays are all fairly old (end 70s to mid 80s) I don't know the publication in question.<br/>- If you're a biologist, skip the first two essays, these are basically modified long dictionary entries showing the current state of evolution and biology. There's a lot in there you've heard before.<br/>- ""The Commodization of Science"" is awesome, a critique of (Western) science as a tool of capitalist expansion, def. recommended (you don't have to agree)<br/><br/>Of course, one can criticize Dialectic approaches as a bit far-strung - it's complicated enough to just look at a one-to-one interaction at one point in time, and success in this can already take a long time (easily more than a normal PhD takes). Analyzing the entire system at once makes things only ""worse"", so to speak. The statistical tools we now (2013) have developed for these ""simple"" interactions are already so complicated that I shudder to think what ""proper"" modelling of a complex system needs.<br/><br/>On the writing: Levins/Lewontin seem to be big fans of the needlessly endless sentence. Definitely no ""pop science"" material!<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're a biologist and you want a very different view on your science, go for it. Similar goes for the interested layman. If, however, you're looking for a fun book you can read on your commute, stay away, for that it's too dry. ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Especially the second to last chapter feels more like an essay ""pro group selection"" than a chapter in a biography. Mentioning the introduction of myxomatosis to Australia with subsequent loss of lethality as a sign of group selection is weird - the more virulent individuals just died faster, leaving the less virulent individuals alive, you don't need to invoke group selection for that (remember Occam's razor?).<br/><br/>Anyway, highly recommended.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

His descriptions and experiences living on the absolute bottom of society is where his political leanings were born - I think this is also where parts of Animal Farm and 1984 come from. <br/><br/>The book is on Gutenberg, but the <a href=""http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79d/"">ebooks@Adelaide version</a> is slightly nicer, although there's about 10-15 scanning errors.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Of course, he can't pass the chance to criticize modern Christianity himself:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Christianity long ago shifted from the side of the poor and dispossessed to that of the rich and aggressive. The liberal Establishment really has little to fear from it and everything to gain. For the most part, it has become the creed of the suburban well-to-do, not the astonishing promise offered to the riffraff and undercover anticolonial militants with whom Jesus himself hung out.<br/></blockquote><br/> <br/>Eagleton is a well-read writer full of wit, and it be great to listen to Eagleton speak.<br/><br/>It gets a bit weird once Eagleton goes all ""religion is not the modern problem, capitalism is!!! Now let's all talk about how great socialism is!"", but I think that is to be expected with his writing. It's similar in ""On Evil"" towards the end.<br/><br/>Fun quote:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The New Testament is a brutal destroyer of human illusions.

If you need information on him, here's an excerpt from Penn & Teller, including a short interview with Borlaug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEBtO25xW-o (NSFW language). In a nutshell, he developed wheat-varieties with extremely high yield, raised Mexico from a poor wheat-importing country to a wheat-exporting country, and prevented famines in India, Pakistan and China.<br/> <br/>Makes for some interesting thoughts on the current GMO-debate (did you know hybrid seeds in the 1930s were not allowed to be re-sold?), mostly because people are now acting the same way they did towards Borlaug's hybrid seeds in the 60s (""it's unnatural"", ""we're too dependent on modern methods"", ""traditional plants go into extinction"" etc.). Especially in the beginning is the writing a bit weird (Quote: ""Contemplating those events upstairs was super scary""), thus the 4 stars.<br/><br/>It's also interesting that Borlaug was able to give seeds of new hybrids away basically for free since he was funded mostly by the Rockefeller Foundation. Good to know that the Foundation is involved in the development of Golden Rice (which is available for free too for developing countries). <br/><br/>Plus it's only $3 on Kindle, so there's that.<br/><br/>Recommended for: Anyone who needs some inspiration on what one person can achieve in their life.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

The only qualm I have is that the author, Frank Brady, has a personal connection to Fischer from Fischer's late childhood on and was deeply impressed by Fischer. <br/><br/>As such, Brady is constantly trying to improve Fischer's image and sometimes he's just trying too hard - for example, in the match Reshevsky v. Fischer (the ""Match of the Century""). Due to one of the sponsors of the match having different obligations the organizers moved the start of the match a couple of hours earlier, and Fischer just wouldn't have that. He simply didn't show up to the game and thus lost it. How does Brady describe it?<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>... the ""Match of the Century"", as it had been billed, was the unfortunate casualty of Bobby's ingrained sleep habits and the long shadow of patronage in chess.<br/></blockquote> (p. 164)<br/><br/>No, it was a casualty of Fischer being an arrogant brat!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd still recommend it, it shows that a) behind a ""genius"" is a mountain of lonely hard work (I guess ""geniuses"" don't really exist?), and b) it's always entertaining to read about douchebags.<br/><br/>P.S.: There's also an interesting connection to the ongoing Snowden-case: When an elderly Fischer was arrested in Japan for being there illegally (his passport was revoked by the US because Fischer committed the crime of playing in the embargoed communist Yugoslavia about 10 years earlier) Iceland made Fischer an Icelandic citizen so that Japan didn't have to extradite Fischer to the US. I guess this is why so many people look to Iceland to help Snowden? But on the other hand, Fischer had prior connections to Iceland - he was seen as something of a national hero since he held a tournament in Iceland some twenty years earlier, which made Iceland internationally known. Snowden does not have any such connection.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

48497,Dancing Naked in the Mind Field,Kary Mullis,"Mullis, Kary",,"=""0679774009""","=""9780679774006""",1,3.81,Vintage,Paperback,240,2000,1998,2013/07/17,2013/06/27,non-fiction,non-fiction (#15),read,"tl;dr: trolling is a art<br/><br/>The problem with ebooks is that you can't throw them against the wall. In this case of Mullis' autobiography, or rather loose collection of essays, I wanted to do exactly that about 5 times - it has been a long time since I've been this physically angry at a book.<br/><br/>The first quarter of the book is alright - he details how he perfected PCR, how he got the Nobel Prize for that, etc. The one thing  that starts to annoy is his constant drive to portray himself as such an unconventional person - ""Hey everybody, I go to strip-clubs! I'm OK with drugs! I was totally spontaneous and cool when I met the wife of the Japanese tenno![1]"" <br/><br/>You just expect at some point to read ""hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is kary but u can call me t3h PeNgU1N oF d00m!!!!!!!! lol…as u can see im very random!!!!"" etc. pp.<br/><br/>Some of the early chapters are interesting, for example, when he tries to explain the scientific method. Why he then goes and throws everything out of the window is beyond me - I think it's because he loves being in a position opposite to the mainstream, even if that means distorting and twisting the truth until it becomes a lie.<br/><br/>First, the chapter about his belief in astrology - his evidence that it exists: 3 people guessed his star-sign. Also, a program used the constellation of planets at his birth to describe his character, and I quote: ""Most of the things that the fifty-page document said about me were correct. But some of them were entirely wrong."" (p. 118). Guess what, that's how horoscopes are written! Make them so vague and general that ""most of the things"" are correct! It doesn't take a scientist to notice that, yet Mullis constantly assures us that he's a scientist. Literally: ""I am a scientist"", at least 3 or 4 times in the book.<br/><br/>Then it gets worse and he ""goes full retard"" (Tropic Thunder, 2008), in his views on global warming: ""What is the trouble with something being out of balance if the natural state of that thing is change?"" (p94).  He then goes on:  ""The concept that human beings are capable of causing the planet to overheat or lose its ozone seems about as ridiculous as blaming the Magdalenian paintings for the last ice age"" (p 96). That's his entire rhetoric - he doesn't cite any proof to the contrary, he just does his impression of Rush Limbaugh. That's it!<br/><br/>We humans can and have changed this planet massively, starting with ""small things"" like the artificial Suez Canal, to changing the entire picture of earth at night. We got enough weapons to irradiate and destroy the surface of the earth. And of course the state of earth is change, the problem we humans might get is that this change might wipe us out. He conveniently doesn't mention this - it doesn't fit his story.<br/><br/>The chapter that made me truly angry is the one where he starts to deny the HIV->AIDS causality, and that's when he gets so self-satisfied and the smugness just oozes out of the pages, into your lap, forcing you to take a shower. He says that the presence of HIV-antibodies shows that HIV has been defeated: ""Antibodies signaled that the virus had been defeated. The patient had saved himself."" (p 139). That's like saying that the presence of soldiers shows that there is no war. <br/><br/>This shows that he either doesn't know a thing about the human immune system or he outright lies to save his worldview, I don't know if Wikipedia was very big in 1998, but a look into an encyclopedia could have certainly helped him. And then he goes in and does these absolutely dirty tricks: ""They didn't show that everybody with the antibodies had the disease. In fact, they found some healthy people with antibodies."" (p 139). That is so dishonest that I'm getting angry again just typing this - it takes <i>time</i> for the symptoms of a disease to develop [2]. <br/><br/>He goes into his descriptions of some of the major players of the early HIV ""controversy"", notably Gallo and Duesberg. He uses language again to make one look good and one look bad: ""In spite of his lack of luster as a scientist, Gallo had worked his way up in the power structure. Peter Duesberg, despite his brilliance, worked his way down"" (p 142). Peter Duesberg is one of the biggest douchebags in recent history, and one of the first HIV-denialists. He used to be the editor at PNAS and used that status to circumvent peer-review for one of his denialist articles, something which Muller describes this way: ""Duesberg pointed out wisely from the sidelines in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science that there was no good evidence implicating the new virus."" (p 143). He again conveniently doesn't mention that Duesberg used his (former) status to get his article into PNAS. He also ignores the HIV-AIDS evidence that was already available in 1998, most disingenuous by saying that ""no-one had proven that HIV causes AIDS"". The problem with proving that is that you have to literally infect a human with HIV, something which no ethics committee in the world will approve. But there are some cases from before the publication of this book which Mullis could have had a look at.<br/><br/>There's the Florida dentist case from 1990, in which a dentist unknowingly infected some of his patients, who were all tested positive for HIV and later died of AIDS, same as the dentist, Wikipedia has an overview: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Bergalis This case was the first case in which someone proved that HIV causes AIDS, something which Mullis conveniently forgets. That was 8 years before this book! Another big case was when three lab workers got infected with HIV and developed AIDS, that was in 1997, maybe too close to the publication of this book (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9045880). There's a mountain of evidence for the causality HIV->AIDS, but Mullis always pretends as if he's the lone warrior showing the world that ""the big pharma-companies"" just want to make money with the disease of others. See here for evidence: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/HIVAIDS/Understanding/howHIVCausesAIDS/Pages/HIVcausesAIDS.aspx<br/> <br/>By the way: after the publication of this book, Duesberg became a member of the advisory panel to Thabo Mbeki in South Africa, and his denialism prevented the use of antiretroviral drugs, one of the main reasons why AIDS spread so much leading to literally hundreds of thousands who died of AIDS in South Africa. That man has <i>a lot</i> of blood on his hand! (Check Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Duesberg)<br/><br/>And then, the prime piece, the one that made me throw my Kindle across the room, the most disgusting sentence I've read all year: ""If a person has three hundred sexual contact a year - with people who themselves are having three hundred contacts a year - that's ninety thousand times more opportunity for infections than a person involved in an exclusive relationship"". (p 146) YES IT'S THEIR OWN FAULT THAT THEY HAVE AIDS. THESE DISGUSTING PIGS AND THEIR FILTHY POLYGAMY!! [3] LET'S ALL SHAME MORE VICTIMS. Edit: According to the WHO, 2% of the 8 million children who die per year die because of AIDS. Did these have too much sex too? (Source: http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/press_materials/fs/fs_mdg4_childmortality/en/index.html)<br/><br/>Does he cite peer-reviewed publications for any of his viewpoints? In one chapter he makes fun of a nutritionist for not citing any sources in her ""crusade"" against margarine, and writes that you should always cite sources. Yet there <i>isn't a single paper cited</i> in this book, a thing you would think a scientist would do.<br/><br/><br/>Of course, there are the other crazy things [4] I don't want to go into because to him, they happened, and I can't criticize that. There's a lot more going on in this book that for the purpose of my sanity I will now forget so I can't write about it here.<br/><br/>The only thing you'll learn in this book is that you shouldn't trust people just because they got a prize, even if it's the Nobel Prize. <br/><br/>[1] Apparently the official title is ""chief wife""? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Japan<br/><br/>[2] especially in HIV that can take up to 3 months, in some cases several years: http://aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/hiv-aids-101/signs-and-symptoms/<br/><br/>[3] capslock is cruise control for rage<br/><br/>[4] Glowing raccoons abducting him over night. Someone saving him from a laughing gas overdose via astral travelling. His telepathy with a friend. That said friend's face morphing into other faces, even though Mullis was sober. etc.<br/>",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Eagleton is a literary theorist and a Marxist and it clearly shows. For him, evil is caused by institutions that make normally ""ok"" people do evil things. He doesn't really support this with studies or any numbers, he rather shows characters from literature as examples for his conclusions, or points to the Nazis. Whether you like that or not is up to you, I think ""hard"" scientists will be annoyed[1]. His writing, however, is beautiful and so <i>British</i>:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Perhaps children murder each other all the time and are simply keeping quiet about it [...]. Perhaps this is because we are ready to believe all kinds of sinister things about children, since they seem like a halfalien race in our midst. Since they do not work, it is not clear what they are for. <br/></blockquote><br/><br/>(p. 4)<br/><br/>or wisely on p. 117, the last page:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But there is a difference between regretting this tragically lost opportunity, and treating one's enemies as mindless beasts whom no rational action could ever conceivably sway. For champions of this viewpoint, the only solution to terrorist violence is more violence. More violence then breeds more terror, which in turn puts more blameless lives at risk. The result of defining terrorism as evil is to exacerbate the problem; and to make the problem worse is to be complicit, however unwittingly, in the very barbarism you condemn.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/><br/>[1] I personally would have at least included the case-study of the murdering necrophiliac homosexual duck to show that ""evil"" in the form of senseless violence exists in nature too: C.W.

Consider two brothers: One is relatively weak but sexually mature at age 10, the other one is stronger but needs more time to sexually mature since his body had to invest resources into strength, let's say he matures by 15.

The background: Lewis met Joy Davidman in life after she came to the UK to separate from her alcoholic/abusive husband. They became friends (""For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual. Joy was the only woman whom he had met ... who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness, in width of interest, and in analytical grasp, and above all in humour and a sense of fun.""), and, after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer, they married in 1956. After a brief relapse she died in 1960. <br/><br/>This very short book is Lewis' way of trying to come to terms with his grief - it's painfully and brutally honest with himself and his confusion about his beliefs. He tries to understand his grief, he tries to understand to position the grief with his beliefs, and eventually he slightly comes to terms with it.<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>The conclusion I dread is not 'So there's no God after all,' but 'So this is what God's really like. Deceive yourself no longer.'<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or this one:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed into your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>When he remembers her and tries to explain the amount of grief he's suffering and tries to come to terms with his grief, that's when <i>someone's</i> cutting onions around you:<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Her absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else. It's not local at all. I suppose that if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice much more in any one food than in another. Eating in general would be different, every day, at every meal. It is like that. The act of living is different all through. Her absence is like the sky, spread over everything.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>I have always been able to pray for the other dead, and I still do, with some confidence. But when I try to pray for H., I halt.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>or <br/><br/><blockquote><br/>Reality, looked at steadily, is unbearable.<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>It's one of the saddest books I've ever read, since it's absolute naked truth.<br/><br/>Recommended for: people who have lost someone.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: Invincible heartless space robots with rockets for feelings",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Along the way he learns the memory tricks that are mostly based on the Greeks' work but are still widely in use today, and uses the opportunity to write about the history of memory, some extremely interesting edge cases (like the guy who inspired Rainman), some of the science behind remembering, how these techniques are having a small renaissance in teaching, and why it is that we can remember some things better than others (for example, spatial memories are easier and faster to remember than numbers). You'll learn that memory champions are not hyper-intelligent <i>savants</i>, but are just people who are well-trained in a specific set of tricks, similar to good magicians (a comparison Foer repeats at least 3 times).<br/><br/>Of course, reading this book won't turn you into a all-remembering memory beast, for these tricks require too much initial work - for example, to remember a deck of cards you first have to remember a vibrant (if possible raunchy) image to connect the card to, so you don't have to remember the card itself, only the image. Coming up with these images in the first place, and subsequently learning them for an entire deck of cards, already takes several days to weeks. And then you're in possession of one of the more useless tricks in the world, congratulations.<br/><br/>And of course, there's one small story at the end to prove that when you're the memory champion you don't have to have a good memory: When Foer returns from the US championship, he drives his car to a restaurant to have dinner with friends. Later he returns home by tram, only to realize at home that he forgot he had a car.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who always wondered what it would be like to know more than 3 digits of Pi.

It's all about Campbell's lifework, which was to compare different mythologies of different cultures and continents and find all the overlapping tropes - and there's lots to be found.<br/><br/>This book shines when Campbell starts to tell all these stories from Native Americans, Inuit, Hindus and Buddhists and shows how they share common motifs and how they are essentially just one big story. It's also great when he criticizes Christianity:<br/><br/><blockquote>Moyers: In the Christian story the serpent is the seducer.<br/><br/>Campbell: That amounts to a refusal to affirm life.</blockquote><br/><br/>I would've given it five stars were it not for Campbell continuously accepting stories as fact, for example:<br/><br/><blockquote>There's a Czechoslovakian psychiatrist, Stanislav Grof, now living in California, who for years treated people with LSD. And he found that some of them re-experienced birth [...]. Isn't it amazing that this repeats just what the myth says?</blockquote><br/><br/>Now Campbell hints here that this is an event re-experiencing something that actually happens, when in reality, it might just have been the drug, no experience necessary. He likes to do this - he often goes out on a leg and states things he can't prove. My biggest peeve is with his central statement of ""Follow your bliss"" - that there's something roughly akin to destiny that is manifested in the things you like. So to be happy you follow that path of your preferences and that is the only way. It's a bit of an unfair thing - if your circumstances prohibit you from following bliss, what then?<br/><br/>He's a bit unfair in other parts, too:<br/><blockquote>Freud tells us to blame our parents for all the shortcomings of our life, and Marx tells us to blame the upper class of our society. But the only one to blame is oneself. That's the helpful thing about the Indian idea of karma. Your life is the fruit of your own doing. You have no one to blame but yourself.</blockquote> - says the Upper Middle Class white guy who could afford to go to university.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I learned a lot about myths and it was a pleasure reading. It's great when he compares the motifs in Star Wars 4-6 to mythological motifs - and they constantly come back to it! He would've hated Episode 1.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who get stuck browsing TVTropes.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: People not interested in the fabrics of society",,,1,,,0,,,,,

When there is a quote from an political opponent or from a newspaper, it's about Lincoln. In a way, that's good - I can't remember more than five names at once, anyway.<br/><br/>It's a relatively thick, very detailed book, but it's never truly dry and boring - rather, the myriads of quoted contemporary sources (newspaper comments, entries from diaries, letter excerpts) give the book an alive atmosphere.<br/><br/>Did I learn anything? Before this book, I thought the American civil war started because Lincoln outlawed slavery, and then people died, and then slavery was gone. Battles may have involved Velociraptors, and at some point Bill and Ted appeared and stole Lincoln thus probably ending the war.<br/><br/>In reality, the war initially wasn't about the abolishment of slavery, but about the spread of slavery - Lincoln campaigned on a ticket that opposed the spread of slavery, and before he even was inaugurated, the South seceded. Interesting! <br/><br/>There's a lot of inspiring stuff about the moral background and the rather scientific way Lincoln approached each problem - rather than outright stating in his politics that slavery is wrong, he approached the problem from each possible viewpoint to see what each party believes. Some of these examinations have survived in Lincoln's private notes! Very interesting. His humble approach to problems like this, his speeches (that he held mostly himself! No empty congress) makes you feel even more depressed about the current state of democracy.<br/><br/>Two minor problems: You need to be a bit acquainted with American politics and geography to truly understand what's going on, sometimes the movements of armies are described relative to landmarks like certain rivers (and poor German me has to look at a map), sometimes the complications in US lawmaking are not fully described as this book is about Lincoln, not bureaucracy. Also: According to Wikipedia, that awesome story about hookers being named after the Union general Hooker and his party-tent during the war (making the recent affair around Petraeus seem very boring) is likely not true, the word 'hooker' has been used in the same context before the general became famous :(",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Post-apocalypse is such a large ""meme"" that post-apoc media has its own list on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_apocalyptic_and_post-apocalyptic_fiction<br/><br/>This one has an interesting twist in that it's about what happens <i>before</i> a known apocalypse, it's ""pre-apocalyptic"", so to speak. A meteorite is on collision course with earth, people know the exact date the collision is going to occur, but not where it's going to strike exactly. People do however know what's going to happen: a massive explosion causing a tsunami, followed by extreme weather all around the globe (remember the dinosaurs?). This knowledge leads to an interesting society, where the market has collapsed, the price for weapons and canned food has skyrocketed, suicides happen by the minute, society is crumbling but governments still exist.<br/><br/>The novel details the first couple of months of the freshly appointed detective Hank Palace, who found one of the many suicides and thinks that something's a little bit off with it, possibly a murder. I loved his character - a bit dreamy and a bit confused about life in general, if he'd work with me in academia he would perfectly fit in. It's his first murder investigation, and even though people around him disappear to tick off items from their bucketlists, he keeps on going, he always wanted this, but is unsure whether he actually likes it. <br/><br/>The world is well-built, sometimes it's a bit boring, but all in all I'd definitely liked the book - satisfying ending, too. I recently finished Ellis' Gun Machine and The Last Policeman feels much more ""alive"", with characters you'd definitely encounter in any given university-town.<br/><br/>Recommended for: post-apoc fans, people who like crime-novels but are annoyed by the usual setting.<br/><br/>Not recommended for: people who can't read about suicide.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I liked it, it's a fun, quick read (took me about a day during a power outage to read it), it has some violence, some fun cliches (clichées?) from and nods to the Noir-genre, nothing that overly strains your brain, nothing that you would remember after a year or so.<br/><br/>Recommended for: People who really enjoy comics, people who need a crime book but are sick of the usual ""whodunit""",,,1,,,0,,,,,

It's a massive book trying to summarize the history of knowledge in the 20th century, ending with the rise of ""pop-science-books"" and starting with <br/><br/>The history of the 20th century is not easy and as such, this book is not really ""bed-lecture"" to be easily digested: it's not uncommon that the authors throws ten names at you in one paragraph. Sometimes the ideas are hard to comprehend, but Watson always does a good job to explain everything in laymen's terms, from arts to literature to economics to biology to physics, not much gets left out. But the book keeps on throwing knowledge at you, there is no time wasted - I feel like I stored maybe 1% of the contained knowledge in my brain. <br/><br/>During reading I got the impression that this book focuses mostly on the west's ideas and concepts, and Watson has a few apologetic paragraphs on this in the end, explaining that most of the new concepts that led us into this golden age have indeed developed in the west - I can't really debate him on that. I'm a biologist, and most of our groundbreaking stuff (DNA-helix, PCR, sequencing machines..) have indeed been developed in the west. <br/><br/>I did enjoy some takedowns, for example I've been taught in High School that Freud was mostly right (German classes! A lot of Mann's and other German authors' works draw heavily from Freud's (dream-)symbolism!), but here the evidence to the contrary is presented (Jung was wrong, too). <br/><br/>One of the biggest takeaways I took from this book is how no idea comes about on its own - everything is based on previous ideas, nothing is 100% new.<br/><br/>I would recommend this book to everyone eager to learn where our ""modern"" ideas (or mental models?) come from - definitely not recommended for people who can't concentrate for longer than 5 minutes.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Why this also introduced quasi-post-apocalyptic stretches of land with roving gangs of children in what feels like the rest of the world is apparently left to the reader's imagination.<br/><br/>How society is supposed to progress when no-one has any time to learn is also left to the reader's imagination. <br/><br/>The main guy Logan is a <i>sandman</i> whose sole job is to go around and shoot <i>runners</i>, people whose time has expired and are on the run. He is of course perfectly trained for this task - until his time expires and he runs away. How he goes from ""system-loving exterminator"" to ""freedom-lover"" is also left to the reader's imagination, it just kinda happens from one page to the other. <br/><br/>He is, of course, not alone, being accompanied by a Jessica, whose sole responsibility in the book is to be the mirror for Logan's thoughts. She's not good for anything else, in fact, she's more useless than a stoned teenager in a horror-movie and, as a character, flatter than a square. Her inexplicable uselessness mostly serves to progress the plot. At one point she has to have sex with a bad guy while Logan has to have sex with six women (the entourage of the bad guy). I don't know why that happened.<br/><br/>This book introduces <i>some</i> Sci-Fi ideas, but doesn't follow their train of thought anywhere - the story rather focusses on the flight of the pair (which - spoiler! - at one point falls in love with each other, another thing which is an absolute miracle - it's not like they really ever talk about anything, or interact, or grow as humans), so if you're more into action with plot that has more holes than my teeth this book might be for you, but -<br/><br/>I don't know who might like this book. People who liked the movie and have some nostalgic soft spot? I never saw that movie, can't tell. People who like cheesy terrible books? Go for it! It's quite short (that's good).",,,1,,,0,,,,,

So if you're looking for a manual for life, you might have to look elsewhere (try the Essais! Or maybe Gracian's ""The art of worldly wisdom""?).<br/><br/>This book is a biography of Michel de Montaigne, former mayor of Bordeaux, French statesman and author of the Essais, a ~1300 pages long collection of short and long essays (one might say blog-posts today) on all matters of things, from politics of the time to how to live properly like a stoic, that made him famous in his lifetime in the 16th century and is still famous today. In the Essais Montaigne describes his personal philosophy (without ever calling it so) of a sceptic stoicism (as well as a million other things, from his life to his politics to his sex-life).<br/><br/>At times dry and funny,<br/><br/><blockquote><br/>As the modern critic David Quint has summed it up, Montaigne would probably interpret the message for humanity in Christ's crucifixion as being ""Don't crucify people"".<br/></blockquote><br/><br/>at other times horrifying (for example, descriptions of atrocities of the French protestant/catholic civil wars), this book is a collection of questions and short answers which serve as loose starting-points for certain aspects of Montaigne's life and works. The book likes to follow Montaigne's loosely connected ""rambling"" style (several times it jumps forward to the death of Montaigne, then back to some political aspect of this work, then to developments in modern criticisms of the Essais, then back to descriptions of his wife), quite enjoyable if you're prepared to jump around a bit. <br/><br/>The book itself is written in a very clear, modern style, I can't find any ""stiff"" non-fiction-style, which makes for a very enjoyable read. The short rules of Montaigne on ""How to live"" are explained using parts of his writing and his life, but the focus is clearly on his life - so this book rather serves as an introduction of his life and contemporaries, a great preparation if you're willing to tackle the main-part, the Esssais themselves. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended, for people who like biographies of unusual people, people who want to know where modern scepticism comes from, and those who love the Essais.",,,1,,,0,,,,,

I mean, <i>look at that name!</i><br/><br/>It's 4 short-stories with the same main character and the same spaceship woven into one book. The main guy seems to be the proto-Spock - a guy trained in a new science called Nexialism, some kind of ""all-sciences-into-one"" with hints of individualism/libertarianism with a healthy dose of what science-fiction in the 50s was like (electronic telepathy, mind-controlling, funky big machines etc).<br/><br/>Each story is about the crew encountering an unknown, but superior alien organism. The first story is a LOT like the first Alien movie (I think the author sued and got some money), and each time the main guy, thanks to his superior intellect and background, defeats the alien using <i>logic</i> (and his gadgets). It's sometimes amusing to see how he prevails over some of the egomaniacs on board, or how well his long ago laid out plans work out, yet sometimes it's too much <i>deus ex machina</i> for my tastes.<br/><br/>Still, great fun if you're into old science-fiction, soft sci-fi or when you ""love it when a plan comes together"".",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Reading about the omnipotent Gods living in their tech-bubble inside the Culture would become boring very fast.<br/><br/>Why it's boring to read - there's nothing to learn or gain for the reader. There are some thinly veiled allegories on mankind, for example the Azad in the second culture-book, ""Player of Games"" with their useless pride and cruel society. You can find better allegories in other books, for example ""Animal Farm"", ""The Library Of Babel"" or something from Saramago. Go read these books if you want to learn about humanity.<br/><br/>Storywise it's relatively straight-forward in all books - someone from inside the culture (or in close contact to it) is sent out to investigate or help with another culture, which is either very interesting or threatening to start a war. The protagonist is usually accompanied by intelligent technology, which safes him or her from most threatening situations using, basically, magic. Sometimes the machines fail to make the story ""dangerous"", but that's it. The main character then goes and solves the conflict using his/her technological wizardry. That's it.<br/><br/>I still give it 3 stars: if you like escapism and dislike this world you live on, read these books. Great world-building and Banks' imaginative mind paired with his storytelling prowess should guarantee that you're entertained.<br/>If you want to learn anything, don't waste your time.",true,,1,,,0,,,,,
